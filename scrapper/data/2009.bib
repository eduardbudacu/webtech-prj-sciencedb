These methodologies, such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), and Feature-Driven Development (FDD) date back to 1990s, and the Agile Manifesto was declared in 2001. However, already before that the concept of agile manufacturing (AM) was discovered to describe a corporate ability for quick adaptation to changing requirements. There is surprising amount in common between these two fields. This raises a question of whether \{NPD\} software development companies could take even more overall advantage of those different agile approaches. This interdisciplinary paper explores the commonalities between the key concepts of \{AM\} and some of the most popular agile software methods, and consequently suggests potential new areas for software process improvement (SPI) in large-scale \{NPD\} organizations. An industrial case example illustrates how agility in embedded software product development can be enhanced by following typical \{NPD\} principles. We conclude that there is potential for further improvements in software product development industry in general by seeing agility as a wider, organization-oriented business concept following the AM/NPD learning. Current agile software process models cover only a subset of this space. "

The study was conducted using an unprecedentedly large-scale survey-based methodology, consisting of respondents who practice \{ASD\} and who had experience practicing plan-driven software development in the past.

In this paper we focus on the functionality of two key physical artefacts – the story card and the Wall – which, individually and in combination, underpin the team’s activity. These artefacts have two main roles – one which enables a shared understanding of requirements and one which facilitates the development process itself. We consider these roles from two perspectives: a notational perspective and a social perspective. This discussion shows how the two perspectives – the notational and the social – intertwine and are mutually supportive. Any attempt to replace these physical artefacts with alternative support for an agile team needs to take account of both perspectives, and the complex relationships between them. "

We found that the teams with the highest job satisfaction are precisely the ones whose members score highest for the personality factors agreeableness and conscientiousness. The satisfaction levels are also higher when the members can decide how to develop and organize their work. On the other hand, the level of satisfaction and cohesion drops the more conflict there is between the team members.

This data usually shows low quality and inconsistencies and it should be examined and treated. It was used a technique of data reconciliation to assess those inconsistencies and generate a set of data that allow reliable analysis, which support decisions about process. The data generated by data reconciliation are going to feed the accounting systems and support decisions of the operation and analysis teams. In order to improve data reconciliation system management data, it became more agile and practical, it is necessary to treat raw data that come from site and were recorded in the refinery information systems. The software developed has a function of capture raw data record in the system of registration and control of operations and link these data with measurements in the refining processes. This pooling of information brings a gain of quantity and quality to the data reconciliation system, reducing mathematical problems of non-solubility drive by configuration of refining processes and allocation of measurements. The software also evaluates the closing of balance sheet of each tank and carries a previous distribution of differences, which come from low precision of measurements. This functionality of system intended that data were as close to reality of the process as possible and also attend accounting requirements, increasingly rigid, imposed to oil refining companies. To achieve this goal, it was made modifications on a consecrated numerical technique, in order to adapt this to the problem and to the singular objective function that mathematically describes the problem. All these analyses are generated by software algorithms and occur automatically in hours previously scheduled. With the data processed in the case of mathematical problems and evaluated in order to attend mass balance constraints, reports are generated and will be used by analysis accounting team of refinery. This software is deployed in the largest Brazilian oil refinery and the data generated through it as used as the basis for the accounting closure of this site. "

Drinking under the risk of predation may elicit similar prey behaviours to those in foraging animals, but has been little studied. Agile wallabies, Macropus agilis, manipulate their environment by excavating drinking holes just out of reach of predatory saltwater crocodiles. Paradoxically, however, some wallabies drink from the river's edge despite the immediate availability of the lower-risk drinking holes. We studied the behaviour of wallabies with multiple drinking options to test a series of predictions for animals drinking under the risk of predation. More wallabies drank during the day than at night, regardless of drinking site. However, night-drinking wallabies were much more likely to use the excavated holes than the ‘riskier’ river. This spatiotemporal dichotomy in perceived predation risk may reflect a mismatch in nocturnal sensory capabilities between predator and prey, and would provide sufficient motivation for wallabies to create low-risk drinking holes. Drinking duration, our surrogate for harvest, was not influenced by drinking site type (hole versus river), drinking time or social context (solitary versus group), suggesting that some animals may not forego drinking during high-risk periods, as predicted and observed for some foraging animals. Compared to wallabies in groups, solitary wallabies were less likely to drink from the river, especially at night, and were more vigilant. Although evidence is limited, our research suggests that vigilance may be ineffective for nocturnally drinking wallabies in the face of this concealed, ambush predator. "

The approach integrates the product modularization-driven postponement and flexible supply chain structuring downstream the order penetration point. The findings suggest that the integrated modularization and customer-oriented dynamical supply chain structuring are significant drivers of the supply chain agility. The elaborated conceptual framework provides deeper insights into supply chain modularization and agility from coordination and customer-oriented collaboration prospects. The concept is supported by mathematical models and information systems. It is the first in the literature that reports an approach of integrated product-process driven modularizing and structuring supply chains considering their inbound and outbound integrity in the immediate value adding processes.

However, not all lean implementations have produced such results. Apparently, this effect is moderated by several factors, potentially even to the point of reversal. It is important to increase our understanding of how this might occur. In this paper, we explore how novelty, complexity, instability, and buffering affect the relationship between lean implementation and production costs. An interest in these factors drew us to study the case of Lockheed Martin's production system for the F-22, an extremely complex and innovative product. To build theory, we synthesize our empirical data from the case with other existing theory, such as theories of learning and complexity. Through this analysis, we develop a revised framework that reconceptualizes the effect of lean on production costs and use it to develop 11 propositions to direct further research. Included among these are propositions about how the timing, scale, and extent of lean implementation can regulate the benefits of lean. Furthermore, when the objective of lean is construed as the provision of value, we propose that this value is an emergent property of a complex process, different from the mere sum of the values provided by its constituent tasks. Therefore, the elimination of tasks will not guarantee cost reduction, and lean may provide even greater value by incorporating some aspects of agile manufacturing. Overall, we develop a fuller range of the effects of lean practices on production costs and illuminate how operations managers might control key variables to draw greater benefits from lean implementation.

The major focus has been given to the implementation of holonic control into the small to medium size manufacturing enterprises (SMEs). The ‘virtual holonic factory’ concept has been introduced, as a test bed for integration of a holonic control into a virtual factory, i.e. three-dimensional \{VR\} model of a factory in order to visually realize the effects of holonic control, when implemented to a real manufacturing system. A case study has been carried out in a medium size die-casting manufacturing plant. Through the virtual factory, a holonic control architecture for flow-line manufacturing system has been implemented for dynamic scheduling of machines in the medium size factory in order to achieve robustness necessary to handle the disturbances. The system performance and key attributes of the holonic control, such as re-configurability and robustness, have been tested and validated by using \{VR\} technology and analysis results have been presented.

An agile enterprise rapidly adapts to changing business challenges and opportunities and continuously improves to optimize cost, quality, and speed of delivery. It enables top management to quickly implement new strategies and control key business parameters to gain competitive advantage. Agility resolves some common business challenges faced by many enterprises. But the agile enterprise does not fit current business models. It requires a new business paradigm—a new way of thinking about the business and new ways of planning, organizing, operating, and controlling the business. Service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process management (BPM), and \{MBM\} are important aspects of this new agile enterprise business paradigm that is enabled by the supporting technologies. These concepts and relationships are applicable across many industries. Manufacturing provides a rich diversity of business functions and challenges, and it touches on most other industries. In financial services, much of the ability to develop and deliver new products depends on information technology. Telecommunications and financial services typically have great opportunities to exploit SOA, since these companies tend to experience many unresolved mergers and acquisitions. The telecommunications business is just starting to undergo major transformation with wireless technology and convergence with cable, the Internet, and entertainment. "

The enterprise must recognize relevant events, analyze the threat or opportunity to determine a resolution, and implement appropriate changes to its business operations to maintain or improve its role in the ecosystem. Enterprises are not only driven by requests for services but also by events that occur both within the enterprise and in the business environment in which the enterprise functions. Not all events drive change. There are many events that occur in the normal course of business, such as receipt of a customer order, a payment became overdue, a defect was detected, a machine failed, a shift ended. However, disruptive events are those that suggest that a change has occurred in the enterprise ecosystem that impacts the ability of the enterprise to achieve optimal value now or particularly in the future. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) can make an enterprise more flexible, accountable, and efficient, but it does not necessarily make it agile. The agile enterprise must be responsive to disruptive events. At the same time, an enterprise that is responsive to disruptive events is not agile if the responses are not timely and effective. \{SOA\} enables changes to be implemented more quickly and efficiently because—capabilities are consolidated and consistent, so changes can be more easily defined and deployed, service units can change their capabilities with minimal impact on other service units, automated business processes can be more quickly changed, and the impact of changes on related products, services, and capabilities can be more easily understood and optimized from an enterprise perspective.

This includes both manual and automated business processes. Information technology provides the ability to model business processes for more precise specifications and the ability to automate processes for controlled execution. Though not all business processes are automated, the speed, reliability, and discipline of automated processes suggest that most business processes should be automated, if possible. In particular, the processes that drive the integration and high-level execution of service unit activities should be automated to support consistent and effective operations. Consequently, though the agile enterprise includes manual business processes, our emphasis here is on the automated business processes that, for the most part, drive the operation of an agile enterprise. \{SOA\} brings a fundamental pattern to the design of business processes. Business processes do not exist independent of service units, and processes are confined to management of activities within an associated service unit. Business processes specify how service units produce value. For readers who are familiar with object-oriented programming, service units are like objects and business processes are like methods. "

The holarchy was defined considering the \{PROSA\} reference architecture relative to which in-line vision-based quality control was added by help of feature-based descriptions of the material flow. Two solutions for production planning are proposed: a knowledge-based algorithm using production rules, and an \{OO\} resolved scheduling rate planner (RSRP) based on variable-timing simulation. Failure- and recovery-management are developed as generic scenarios embedding the \{CNP\} mechanism into production self-rescheduling. Aggregate Order Holon execution is realized by OPC-based \{PLC\} software integration and event-driven product transportation. The holonic control of multiple networked robot-vision stations also features tolerance to station computer- (IBM PC-type), station controller- (robot controller), quality control- (machine vision) and communication- (LAN) failure. Fault tolerance and high availability at shop-floor level are provided due to the multiple physical communication capabilities of the robot controllers, to their multiple-axis multitasking operating capability, and to hardware redundancy of single points of failure (SPOF). Implementing solutions and experiments are reported for a 6-station robot-vision assembly cell with twin-track closed-loop pallet transportation system and product-racking RD/WR devices. Future developments will consider manufacturing integration at enterprise level. "

However, most of the current MPCS, employed the hierarchical planning approach, may have some drawbacks, such as structural rigidity, difficulty of designing a control system, and lack of flexibility. Currently, \{RFID\} (Radio Frequency Identification) technology has been applied to enhance the visibility, accountability, track ability and traceability of manufacturing system whenever the accurate and detailed manufacturing information (e.g., raw material, WIP, products in factory and products in the down streams) of products will be followed in real-time basis by \{RFID\} technique. In addition, a multi-agent approach may be applied in a distributed and autonomous system which allows negotiation-based decision making. Therefore, the objective of this research is to study the application of \{RFID\} technique and multi-agent system (MAS) in developing an agent-based agile manufacturing planning and control system (AMPCS) to respond to the dynamically changing manufacturing activities and exceptions. In AMPCS, RFID-based manufacturing control (R-MC) module plays the role of controlling the manufacturing system in which production items and manufacturing resources attached with \{RFID\} tag may actively feedback production status to and receive production and operations schedule from advanced manufacturing planning (AMP) module. In addition, a bidding process and algorithm is developed to generate operations schedule by using the characteristics of MAS. Performance analysis (PA) module is responsible not only for evaluating the scheduling results but also for evaluating the performance of production execution. The development of an \{AMPCS\} for an automated manufacturing cell demonstrates that the integration of \{RFID\} technique and \{MAS\} in developing an agile manufacturing planning and control system can really possess the characteristics of visibility, accountability, track ability, responsiveness, and flexibility in a distributed and dynamic manufacturing system.

It reviews and leverages previous standards, research, and commercial implementations for policy engines, and applies them to the architecture and design of policy engines for CRs. The concept of automatic policy management of resources has its commercial roots in the administration of information systems and networks. Policy management refers to a particular approach for automating network management activities by specifying organizational objectives that can be interpreted and enforced by the network itself. The automatic application of management policies provides flexibility to change the configuration of network devices at runtime to satisfy administrative goals and constraints regarding security, resource allocation, application priorities, or quality of service.

Knowing the rotation motion of the moving platform, we develop first the inverse kinematical problem and determine the velocities and accelerations.

In this paper, by proposing an architecture based up on multi-agent system (MAS), a model is developed to tackle such problems as the nature of supply chain distributions, dynamic distributions systems (DS), uncertain parameters in DS, management of diverse objectives in DS, need for flexibility in \{DS\} and other factors considered as challenges and designing requirements in an agile model which can be all found in the SCM. \{MAS\} was used in this article owing to their special attributes and features.

Using the resource-based view of the firm as our theoretical lens, we examine three research questions: what \{IS\} resources are needed in crisis response, how are these \{IS\} resources bundled with other non-IS resources, and how are they effectively coordinated? Our analysis of the case suggests that existing assets such as information technology infrastructure, leadership, and collaborative networks and existing capabilities such as the ability to build and apply IT, the ability to recognize signals and the ability to see the big picture are critical during crisis response. The actions taken using these assets and capabilities include informing resolutely, gaining stakeholder commitment and agile mobilizing of people and IT. Our analysis further suggests that coordination mechanisms, namely the crisis response organizational, informational, and \{IT\} structures, are important facilitators of the response actions. The resulting framework of resource deployment during crisis response extends the resource based view of the firm into a cooperative setting, aiming to understand the nature of \{IS\} resource value in a cooperative context, and considers not just the resources per se, but the means of coordination the resources.

Two categories of changes in the manufacturing system are considered: (i) changes occurring in resource status at process level: resource breakdown, failure of (vision-based) in-line inspection operation, and depletion of local robot storages; (ii) changes in production orders at business (ERP) level: rush orders. All these situations trigger production plan update and rescheduling (redefine the list of Order Holons) by pipelining CNP-type resource bidding at shop-floor horizon with global product scheduling at aggregate batch horizon. Failure- and recovery management are developed as generic scenarios embedding the \{CNP\} mechanism into production self-rescheduling.

A top-down model oriented around the business value chain that defines business demand in real time and drives the dynamic allocation of virtual resources from tailored fit-for-purpose physical resources leads to an effective business solution and resource efficient Next Generation Datacenter (NGDC). Becoming top-down business-demand focused requires a more nimble infrastructure design and a radically different management model. The primary goal of a top-down design is to be responsive to real-time business events. \{RTI\} design requires a significant understanding of the needs of the environment. The introduction of Fit-for-Purpose \{RTI\} as an approach for \{IT\} to become more agile is not just about buying particular sets of technology.

Forty-three permanent ponds were surveyed in a 2600 km2 area. The average number of egg masses per pond was 211.13 (SD = 426.41). The egg mass number was significantly and positively related to the emergent aquatic macrophyte cover (its effect peaks at around 50%) and the green connecting corridors between the ponds and forests, and negatively related to the extent of nearby urban areas. The proximity of the forest (positive effect) and the presence of high traffic roads (negative effect) were highly correlated with green corridors and further eliminated from the model due to multicollinearity. Both these variables had significant effects when incorporated in univariate models and multivariate models without green corridors. Since a large part of our study area was currently declared as Natura 2000 site, there is an increased need for management proposals and conservation applications for biodiversity, including amphibians.

It will probably be required that manufacturing systems be agile, flexible, and fault-tolerant. Petri nets (PN) and object-oriented design (OOD) are used together in order to develop the integrated agent-based \{FMS\} control system. The flexible manufacturing system (FMS) consists of machines, workstations, and automated material handling system, distributed buffer storage sites and computer-based supervisory control, all which can be modeled as an agent in \{OOD\} with PN. This paper introduces the design of an agent-based \{FMS\} control system through \{PNs\} and evaluates the performance using timed placed Petri nets (TPPN). In order to do so, the agent control design, \{FMS\} structure has been evaluated in detail and the agent definitions have been submitted. The system includes the sharing and distribution of tasks among agents and the mentioned structure has been simulated by TPPN. The simulation procedure has been realized through Petri Net 2.0—MATLAB Demo Program [Mahulea CF, Motcovschi MH, Pastravanu O. Department of Automatic Control Industrial Informatics, Technical University “Gh. Asachi” of Iasi, Blvd., Mangeron 53A, 6600 Iasi, Romania, 〈http://www.ac.tuiasi.ro/pntool,pntool@ac.tuiasi.ro〉, 2004.]. Each case is modeled, and then the agent's machine processing time is considered in this program. As for the evaluation of the study, the system performance is assessed through the waiting time of the parts in queue and the task distributions. "

It is recognised that insiders pose security risks due to their legitimate access to facilities and information, knowledge of the organisation and the location of valuable assets. Insiders will know how to achieve the greatest impact whilst leaving little evidence. However, organisations may not have employed effective risk management regimes to deal with the speed and scale of change, for example the rise of outsourcing. Outsourcing can lead to the fragmentation of protection barriers and controls and increase the number of people treated as full time employees. Regional and cultural differences will manifest themselves in differing security threat and risk profiles. At the same time, the recession is causing significant individual (and organisational) uncertainty and may prompt an increase in abnormal behaviour in long-term employees and managers – those traditionally most trusted – including members of the security community. In this environment, how can organisations know who to trust and how to maintain this trust? The paper describes a practitioner’s view of the issue and the approaches used by \{BT\} to assess and address insider threats and risks. Proactive measures need to be taken to mitigate against insider attacks rather than reactive measures after the event. A key priority is to include a focus on insiders within security risk assessments and compliance regimes. The application of technology alone will not provide solutions. Security controls need to be workable in a variety of environments and designed, implemented and maintained with people’s behaviour in mind. Solutions need to be agile and build and maintain trust and secure relationships over time. This requires a focus on human factors, education and awareness and greater attention on the security ‘aftercare’ of employees and third parties. "

The target satellite, called Fengyun-1C, had a mass of 880 kg and was orbiting at an altitude of about 863 km when the collision occurred. Struck by a direct-ascent interceptor at a speed of 9.36 km/s, the satellite disintegrated, spreading the cataloged fragments between 200 and 4000 km, with the highest concentration near the breakup height. By the end of April 2008, 2377 pieces of debris, including the original payload remnant, had officially been cataloged by the \{US\} Space Surveillance Network. Of these, nearly 1% had reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. This deliberate act is the largest debris-generating event on record, and its consequences will adversely affect circumterrestrial space for many years. In an attempt to assess the impact of the Fengyun-1C breakup on the low Earth environment, the cloud of cataloged debris was propagated for nearly 8 years, taking into account the relevant orbit perturbations and a debris cloud ballistic coefficient distribution based on orbit decay calibrations. The immediate consequence of the Chinese anti-satellite test was to significantly increase the probability of collision with man-made debris. For the Italian spacecraft launched in the first half of 2007, the collision probability with cataloged objects increased by 10% for AGILE, in equatorial orbit, and by 60% for COSMO-SkyMed 1 and 2, in sun-synchronous orbit. During the next few years, the debris cloud generated by the Fengyun-1C breakup was found to remain relatively stable, with nearly 80% of the cataloged fragments still in orbit about 9 years after the event.

The frequencies and bandwidth of available white spaces will of course vary in these networks. Hence a DySPAN transmitter will need to be capable of frequency agile and bandwidth-adaptive transmissions and a DySPAN receiver will need to accordingly respond to any changes made by a transmitter. This paper introduces a novel space–time (ST) scheme that facilitates the detection of bandwidth-adaptive transmissions without the need for a control channel. The scheme is based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and ensures a high diversity gain. By using multiple transmit antennas, the proposed scheme also allows the application of \{ST\} block-coded \{OFDM\} (STBC-OFDM) which not only increases the robustness against bit errors but also preserves the spectral efficiency of the system. For frequency acquisition and bandwidth estimation, the receiving nodes in the DySPAN exploit the cyclostationary signatures intentionally embedded in the \{OFDM\} signals using a small set of subcarriers. In this way, communication links are established autonomously without any need for control channels. The \{ST\} scheme in this paper carries out appropriate multi-antenna transmissions of the signature information on the aforementioned subcarriers, which result in highly robust cyclostationary feature detection over the frequency selective multipath fading channels. Moreover, lower bit-error rates (BERs) are attained by applying STBC-OFDM to the data symbols on the rest of the subcarriers. Both feature detection and the \{BER\} performance are improved further by deploying multiple receive antennas. Detailed performance comparisons are presented by using simulation results. "

abstract = "In today’s fast paced military operational environment, vast amounts of information must be sorted out and fused not only to allow commanders to make situation assessments, but also to support the generation of hypotheses about enemy force disposition and enemy intent. Current information fusion technology has the following two limitations. First, current approaches do not consider the battlefield context as a first class entity. In contrast, we consider situational context in terms of terrain analysis and inference. Second, there are no integrated and implemented models of the high-level fusion process. This paper describes the HiLIFE (High-Level Information Fusion Environment) computational framework for seamless integration of high levels of fusion (levels 2, 3 and 4). The crucial components of HiLIFE that we present in this paper are: (1) multi-sensor fusion algorithms and their performance results that operate in heterogeneous sensor networks to determine not only single targets but also force aggregates, (2) computational approaches for terrain-based analysis and inference that automatically combine low-level terrain features (such as forested areas, rivers, etc.) and additional information, such as weather, and transforms them into high-level militarily relevant abstractions, such as NO-GO, SLOW-GO areas, avenues of approach, and engagement areas, (3) a model for inferring adversary intent by mapping sensor readings of opponent forces to possible opponent goals and actions, and (4) sensor management for positioning intelligence collection assets for further data acquisition. The HiLIFE framework closes the loop on information fusion by specifying how the different components can computationally work together in a coherent system. Furthermore, the framework is inspired by a military process, the Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield, that grounds the framework in practice. HiLIFE is integrated with a distributed military simulation system, OTBSAF, and the \{RETSINA\} multi-agent infrastructure to provide agile and sophisticated reasoning. In addition, the paper presents validation results of the automated terrain analysis that were obtained through experiments using military intelligence Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). "

Eventually the shop floor will have to react and accommodate (re)adjustments in the supply chain making it an important piece in the competitiveness puzzle. So far, the research focus has been in high level aspects of supply chain management and the integration of shop floor activities in the process has been left relatively unattended. However, shop floor data is increasingly required in business tools that support decision making. In this context, failing to support agility at shop floor level can compromise the agility of the supply chain. Recent developments in networked information technologies and embedded devices allow enabling intelligence in shop floor rendering it an active and live entity that further enhances the dynamics of the supply chain. The goal of the present work, supported by an implemented test case in the assembly domain, is to demonstrate how one is able to seamless integrate the shop floor with external tools and achieve a highly reconfigurable environment that adapts to changing production requirements and disturbances using service-oriented technology.
