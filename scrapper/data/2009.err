In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art of the research in this area by conducting a survey-based ex-post-facto study for identifying factors from the perspective of the \{ASD\} practitioners that will influence the success of projects that adopt \{ASD\} practices. In this paper, we describe a hypothetical success factors framework we developed to address our research question, the hypotheses we conjectured, the research methodology, the data analysis techniques we used to validate the hypotheses, and the results we obtained from data analysis. The study was conducted using an unprecedentedly large-scale survey-based methodology, consisting of respondents who practice \{ASD\} and who had experience practicing plan-driven software development in the past. The study indicates that nine of the 14 hypothesized factors have statistically significant relationship with "Success". The important success factors that were found are: customer satisfaction, customer collaboration, customer commitment, decision time, corporate culture, control, personal characteristics, societal culture, and training and learning.

The experimental results showed that Test First teams spent a larger percentage of time on testing. The achievable minimum external quality of delivered software applications increased with the percentage of time spent on testing regardless of the testing strategy (TF or TL) applied, although there does not exist a linear correlation between them. With four years' data, it is also found that a strong linear correlation between the amount of effort spent on testing and coding in Test First teams, while this phenomenon was not observed in Test Last teams.

An agile enterprise rapidly adapts to changing business challenges and opportunities and continuously improves to optimize cost, quality, and speed of delivery. It enables top management to quickly implement new strategies and control key business parameters to gain competitive advantage. Agility resolves some common business challenges faced by many enterprises. But the agile enterprise does not fit current business models. It requires a new business paradigm--a new way of thinking about the business and new ways of planning, organizing, operating, and controlling the business. Service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process management (BPM), and \{MBM\} are important aspects of this new agile enterprise business paradigm that is enabled by the supporting technologies. These concepts and relationships are applicable across many industries. Manufacturing provides a rich diversity of business functions and challenges, and it touches on most other industries. In financial services, much of the ability to develop and deliver new products depends on information technology. Telecommunications and financial services typically have great opportunities to exploit SOA, since these companies tend to experience many unresolved mergers and acquisitions. The telecommunications business is just starting to undergo major transformation with wireless technology and convergence with cable, the Internet, and entertainment. "

It also empowers individual service units to optimize the value they contribute from an enterprise perspective while holding them accountable for meeting performance objectives and complying with enterprise directives and government regulations. Many factors must converge to achieve the agile enterprise level.

Its purpose is to provide an understanding of the requirements and approaches for optimizing security for services, from an enterprise perspective, so that management can plan for and commit to the necessary enterprise transformation. With the advent of the public Internet and the World Wide Web, security risks have increased dramatically. Systems are exposed to public access and email messages can carry or link to corrupting software. Automation and electronic communications have added new dimensions to security concerns. Electronic integration of services, extending beyond the walls of the enterprise, has created new security exposures.

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on how events drive change in the enterprise. The enterprise must recognize relevant events, analyze the threat or opportunity to determine a resolution, and implement appropriate changes to its business operations to maintain or improve its role in the ecosystem. Enterprises are not only driven by requests for services but also by events that occur both within the enterprise and in the business environment in which the enterprise functions. Not all events drive change. There are many events that occur in the normal course of business, such as receipt of a customer order, a payment became overdue, a defect was detected, a machine failed, a shift ended. However, disruptive events are those that suggest that a change has occurred in the enterprise ecosystem that impacts the ability of the enterprise to achieve optimal value now or particularly in the future. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) can make an enterprise more flexible, accountable, and efficient, but it does not necessarily make it agile. The agile enterprise must be responsive to disruptive events. At the same time, an enterprise that is responsive to disruptive events is not agile if the responses are not timely and effective. \{SOA\} enables changes to be implemented more quickly and efficiently because--capabilities are consolidated and consistent, so changes can be more easily defined and deployed, service units can change their capabilities with minimal impact on other service units, automated business processes can be more quickly changed, and the impact of changes on related products, services, and capabilities can be more easily understood and optimized from an enterprise perspective.

This includes both manual and automated business processes. Information technology provides the ability to model business processes for more precise specifications and the ability to automate processes for controlled execution. Though not all business processes are automated, the speed, reliability, and discipline of automated processes suggest that most business processes should be automated, if possible. In particular, the processes that drive the integration and high-level execution of service unit activities should be automated to support consistent and effective operations. Consequently, though the agile enterprise includes manual business processes, our emphasis here is on the automated business processes that, for the most part, drive the operation of an agile enterprise. \{SOA\} brings a fundamental pattern to the design of business processes. Business processes do not exist independent of service units, and processes are confined to management of activities within an associated service unit. Business processes specify how service units produce value. For readers who are familiar with object-oriented programming, service units are like objects and business processes are like methods. "

Policy management refers to a particular approach for automating network management activities by specifying organizational objectives that can be interpreted and enforced by the network itself. The automatic application of management policies provides flexibility to change the configuration of network devices at runtime to satisfy administrative goals and constraints regarding security, resource allocation, application priorities, or quality of service.

A top-down model oriented around the business value chain that defines business demand in real time and drives the dynamic allocation of virtual resources from tailored fit-for-purpose physical resources leads to an effective business solution and resource efficient Next Generation Datacenter (NGDC). Becoming top-down business-demand focused requires a more nimble infrastructure design and a radically different management model. The primary goal of a top-down design is to be responsive to real-time business events. \{RTI\} design requires a significant understanding of the needs of the environment. The introduction of Fit-for-Purpose \{RTI\} as an approach for \{IT\} to become more agile is not just about buying particular sets of technology. The Next Generation Datacenter reference architecture is used to guide the design and construction approaches necessary to build the NGDC.
