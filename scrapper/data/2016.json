Agile practices emphasize frequent releases with the help of an automated toolchain from code to delivery. Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery, what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to customers. Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering delivery activities. Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used tools, such as \\{UI\\} testing and performance testing, were more distinctly missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current workflows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were able to deploy software more rapidly. Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals of the case organizations. Still, a well-founded toolchain supports speedy delivery of new software.

Although communication is key in the exchange of information between team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, \\{IT\\} infrastructure, etc.) and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic. Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD. The research question to which this study responds concerns how development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members, communication of the status of the development process, and communication of the status of the progress of the product under development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository tools, with information from the process development and product characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share information about the status of the project/process/product during the development process in order to overcome some of the still existing problems in communication in AGSD.

It relies on the analysis of an original, qualitative study of agile software development teams, which operate in an environment characterized by the simultaneous implementation of interdependent organizational routines. We argue that the interdependencies among routines are seized by organizational members who manipulate the level of 'protection' that each routine is granted (i.e. the enforcement of adherence to the routine). Less protection permits flexibility, whereas more protection creates stability. We observe that 'protection' can be exerted along two different, yet related, dimensions: content of the routine and performance of the routine. The interplay of these two dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility.

Agile methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of teams on the same development programme. Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories used in the development process. Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews, supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in data analysis. Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance. It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to specific activities within each of the agile roles. Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding ceremonies.

It seems that the two 'camps' show only limited interest/motivation to collaborate with one other. Many researchers and practitioners have written about the challenges, success patterns (what to do, i.e., how to collaborate) and anti-patterns (what not do do) for industry-academia collaborations. Objective: To identify (a) the challenges to avoid risks to the collaboration by being aware of the challenges, (b) the best practices to provide an inventory of practices (patterns) allowing for an informed choice of practices to use when planning and conducting collaborative projects. Method: A systematic review has been conducted. Synthesis has been done using grounded-theory based coding procedures. Results: Through thematic analysis we identified 10 challenge themes and 17 best practice themes. A key outcome was the inventory of best practices, the most common ones recommended in different contexts were to hold regular workshops and seminars with industry, assure continuous learning from industry and academic sides, ensure management engagement, the need for a champion, basing research on real-world problems, showing explicit benefits to the industry partner, be agile during the collaboration, and the co-location of the researcher on the industry side.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software size measurement approaches more, or use different software development methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in small versus large companies? Objective Our objective is to get an understanding into the cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific demographic (e.g., small versus large companies). Thus, we decided to conduct an exploratory study in this area and collected real industrial data in the context of Turkey which has a vibrant software industry. Method To achieve the above objective, we use the data from a recent Turkish-wide survey of software engineering practices which was systematically designed with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian context and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). 202 practicing software engineers participated in the survey. We raise a set of 12 research questions about the cross-factor correlation of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics, and address them using statistical analysis. Results The exploratory study results reveal important and interesting findings about cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics. Among some of the most interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and \\{SE\\} tasks; (2) Almost 55% of participants measure software size; (3) Agile/lean development is used the least (16%) by the participants working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4) Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small-sized companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme programming practices decreases. Conclusion The results of this exploratory study will be useful to software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and challenging experiences in using \\{SE\\} tools?, and (3) Why is Agile/lean development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how these approaches could be utilized more frequently.

While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. Objective We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. Method We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. Results The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. Conclusions The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering.

Considering that instrumental approaches for project management are not sufficient for a flexible and uncertain product as software, the project success depends on how software project managers deal with the problems and make decisions. Different from the normative decision theory, which focus on how decisions should be made in order to be rational, the descriptive decision theory focus on how decisions are actually made and includes the naturalistic decision making models. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper aims to synthetize empirical studies published on journals and conferences proceedings that analyze the decision-making phenomenon in the software project management context from a naturalistic perspective. The search were conducted in five search engines: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, \\{IEEE\\} Xplore, and \\{ACM\\} Digital Library. The 27 selected papers were categorized and then synthesized into a thematic map. The categories included: agile development practices, stakeholders involvement, escalation and de-escalation of commitment factors, participatory decision-making, communication, use of rational methods, emotion, and cognitive biases. The results indicate that more studies are needed to better understand the decision-making phenomenon from this perspective.

For the benefit of academia and industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken. Objective This paper investigates two research questions: what challenges do agile practitioners face? and, how do practitioner challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify implications for research that is relevant to practice. Method A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to previous publications. Results Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under 27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation, sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which were inter-related. Over 50% of survey respondents experienced challenges highlighted in the case study. Conclusion The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such as governance and contracts, are under-researched, while others, such as business and \\{IT\\} transformation, have been researched but findings have not had the expected impact. Researchers wishing to address practitioner challenges need to treat them in context rather than in isolation and improve knowledge transfer.

Self-organizing agile teams are meant to share project management activities such as estimation, planning, and requirements elicitation with managers and customers. While prior literature has explored some individual management-related issues, little is known about how the high involvement of self-organizing agile teams influences everyday project management activities. Through a Grounded Theory study involving 21 agile practitioners across six software companies implementing scrum and XP, we identified a set of eight project management challenges as experienced by and as a result of self-organizing agile teams at multiple levels. These include delayed/changing requirements and eliciting senior management sponsorship at the project level; achieving cross-functionality and effective estimations at the team level; asserting autonomy and self-assignment at the individual level, and lack of acceptance criteria and dependencies at the task level. A mapping between the emergent challenges and standard project management activities is also presented.

The present study aims to identify how daily stand-up meetings are conducted and what the attitudes towards them are. A grounded theory study with 12 software teams in three companies in Malaysia, Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom was conducted. We interviewed 60 people, observed 79 daily stand-up meetings and collected supplementary data. The factors that contributed the most to a positive attitude towards the daily stand-up meeting were information sharing with the team and the opportunity to discuss and solve problems. The factors that contributed the most to a negative attitude were status reporting to the manager and that the frequency of the meeting was perceived to be too high and the duration too long. Based on our results, we developed a grounded theory of daily stand-up meetings and proposed empirically based recommendations and guidelines on how to organize them. Organizations should be aware of the factors that may affect the attitude towards daily stand-up meetings and should consider our recommendations and guidelines to make this agile practice as valuable as possible.

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering for students' individual learning characteristics. To address this issue, learning styles become effective to understand students' different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the students' learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting students' learning style. Test results corroborate that students' outcomes improved when receiving the strategy that match their learning styles. Our data highlight opportunities for improving software engineering education by considering the students' learning preferences.

A case study of three industrial cases was carried out to understand how to tailor agile methods effectively including also hardware development. Agile practices, mostly derived from Scrum, were tailored to fit the needs of each team and the method development was closely followed. Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were compared and complemented with interviews to understand the new working methods and their effects. Case evidence shows that interdependencies between work of each developer were taken into account better, visibility over the whole product increased and need for internal documentation diminished due to improved communication, but dividing hardware tasks into iterations was experienced difficult. With some tailoring, agile practices are beneficial also in the embedded system development. To successfully adopt agile methods into embedded system development, the team must consist of all the project members, the natural cycle lengths of different disciplines and different knowledge between the developers must be accepted and built upon, and the progress of the product must be presented or visualized in the end of each iteration.

The new paradigm greatly applies to military vehicles for the radical improvement of tactical and operational mobility. This article presents a new technological paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics that is studied as an extremely fast and exact response of the tire-soil couple to (i) the tire dynamic loading, (ii) transient changes of gripping and rolling resistance conditions on uniform stochastic terrains and (iii) rapid transient changes from one uniform terrain to a different uniform terrain. Tire longitudinal relaxation lengths are analyzed to characterize the longitudinal relaxation time constants. A set of agile characteristics is also considered to analyze agile tire slippage dynamics within a time interval that is close to the tire longitudinal relaxation time constants. The presented paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics lays out a foundation to radically enhance vehicle terrain mobility by controlling the tire slippage in its transient phases to prevent the immobilization of a vehicle. Control development basis and requirements for implementing an agile tire slippage control are also analyzed and considered.

Volatile requirements and complex interdependencies are the main challenges which agile methods originating from software development are designed for. To examine transferability of several agile methods to the predevelopment of hardware, the authors first theoretically analysed existing methods regarding their potential. While adopting the most promising methods, a case study regarding the production technology for electrical energy storage systems was conducted. It showed that many agile aspects and tools are easily adoptable and help developers in the early stage depending on group size and complexity. They contribute by ensuring that complexity remains manageable, encouraging close teamwork, improving information circulation and supporting transparency. Thus agile methods supplement concurrent predevelopment.

Increasing tough and competitive situations at demand-side have led the stakeholders of power system to reform, because people are more informed and can make decisions that has given rise to turbulent and volatile electricity markets. In such highly diversified and open market environment, the integrated control strategy has expedited the concept of Demand Response. Currently, the important questions in the area of demand response are likely to shift from whether to adopt dynamic pricing to how to achieve fast demand response by the combination of technology and a competitive retail electricity market. This paper assembles the part and parcel in the light of existing technologies for the development of the concept of agility in demand response, that can play a role as a service package which is designed to meet the customer satisfaction efficiently and reliably as well as improve the market responsiveness. For the first time, this paper encompasses the concept of Agile Demand Response that is defined as the ability of power system to survive and prosper in the competitive retail market by reacting to the market needs fast and effectively which are driven by the customers. This paper also presents the key enablers of the agile demand response, which are (1) Retail Market, (2) Virtual Supply-demand matching mechanism, (3) Integrated information system and (4) Stay Committed. The paper concludes that by bringing the enablers together - Agile \\{DR\\} improves the responsiveness to the retail market changes unambiguously.

When traditional sequential development processes are employed the high degree of uncertainty connected to these innovations results in a long and costly development time, potentially leading to failure of the project. The paper at hand recommends highly iterative prototyping processes based on findings from the software industry where agile processes, mostly Scrum, are widely employed. In the development of physical products, prototyping is often unsystematic which is considered as a major obstacle to an efficient agile development process. This paper presents a systematic method of prototyping in the context of physical product development in order to gradually reduce the high degree of market and technological uncertainty associated with radical innovations. The prioritization of requirements is suggested to be the basis for the design of adequate prototypes. An analytical information-oriented approach is presented that continuously takes into account the amount of uncertainty in the dimensions market, product and process. The evaluation of the specific ratio of benefit and effort connected to the implementation of the requirements leads to their prioritization.

In this context, a comprehensive description (ontology) of involved components has a high significance. If certain technological aspects are missing during a production process, the production control should respond in a dynamic, versatile and adaptive (agile) manner to the overall value network. The possibility to describe the requirements of products for the necessary processes in the same namespace like the requirements of the necessary processes for the resources is a prerequisite to enable this behavior. Afterwards the different requirements will be placed in relation to the respective requirements. The aim is to define the necessary processes for the production based on the description of the product and the known resources in an agile way. Due to this a framework for a comprehensive description of automated production facilities, products and processes is described in this paper. The idea is that based on this framework a production facility can change the produced products without dedicated commissioning and ramp-up phases.

These dependencies delay delivery and as a result deteriorate the business value delivered in such value chains. The objective of our study is to support enterprises that suffer from such dependencies with a governance framework that helps them mitigate collaboration issues between sets of codependent Scrum teams. We first identify a set of intervention actions that aim to mitigate the collaboration issues between codependent Scrum teams. Second, we validate the effectiveness of these intervention actions in a large confirmatory industrial case study. This study was held in a large multi-national financial institute that worked with a large number of codependent Scrum teams. Third, we triangulate the findings in three focus groups. We finally package the intervention actions in a governance framework. The intervention actions led to a delivery time reduction from 29 days to 10 days. The participants in the focus groups confirmed the causality between the intervention actions and the observed delivery improvement. The empirical results show that the intervention actions, packaged in the governance framework, enable codependent sets of Scrum teams to deliver faster.

The smart factory approach and the research and development pursuit of the fourth industrial revolution necessitate the refurbishment and upgrade of already existing manufacturing systems and the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in automation systems in order to achieve a holistic, company-wide information exchange and a pervasive traceability of product and manufacturing data. According to this approach, previous programmable logical controls (PLC), established business intelligence solutions and existing manufacturing execution systems (MES) with mutually lacking interfaces are integrated into a new ecosystem for planning, executing and analysis applications. Due to the fact that each system persists on its own user interface, the implementation has to be strongly coupled to a user centered design of innovative human machine interfaces, joined into one distributed, networked application. In this paper, an agile information processing framework for foundry purposes is presented. Every underlying application is accessible via web-based user interfaces providing control of each single system. This leads into a service orientated architecture triggering the individual underlying systems as services, which are connected using web communication technology to exchange data along a shared information model. The data storage is modular to ensure scalability and interoperability with other manufacturing departments. During the actual manufacturing process, different services like inline data mining analysis are deployed and the results are visualized in user demanded dashboards and reports. For new requirements in business intelligence and \\{MES\\} the developed interfaces are provided in a unique library and a content management system. The described architecture enhances the development of new information applications, accelerates the planning and execution process and is completely orientated to the demands of users, as fast planning procedures and analysis driven user interfaces.

Yet many organizations are unable to adapt effectively or quickly due to the established institutional arrangements and patterns of decision-making and governance. Adaptive governance should enhance the capacity of an organization to deal with and adapt to changes, while protecting the same organization from becoming unstable. Strategies of adaptive governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities, decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for governments. This means that adaptive governance implies a 'balancing act', and a reliance on ambidextrous strategies.

Objective The main objective is to better understand the characteristics of successful software projects and contribute to software projects that are more likely to produce the planned client benefits. Method We asked 63 Norwegian software professionals, representing both the client and the provider role, to report information about their last completed project. In a follow-up survey with 64 Norwegian software professionals, we addressed selected findings from the first survey. Results The analysis of the project information showed the following: i) The project management triangle criteria of being on time, on budget, and having the specified functionality are poor correlates of the essential success dimension client benefits. ii) Benefit management planning before the project started and benefit management activities during project execution were connected with success in delivering client benefits. iii) Fixed-price projects and projects in which the selection of providers had a strong focus on low price were less successful in delivering project benefits than other projects. iv) Agile projects were in general more successful than other projects, but agile projects without flexible scope to reflect changed user needs and learning, or without frequent delivery to the client, had less than average success in delivering client benefits. Conclusions The software projects that were successful in delivering client benefits differed from the less successful ones in several ways. In particular, they applied benefit management practices during project execution, they avoided fixed-price contracts, they had less focus on low price in the selection of providers, and they applied the core agile practices - frequent delivery to the client and scope flexibility.

In particular, Scrum is an agile process framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11 companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns. The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum, and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where available, we have included company recommendations regarding the deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum concepts.

It provides an attractive alternative to more established development methods such as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). Given the growing demands for using agile methods for software development, we examine if systems analysts are more effective at modeling business systems by reusing business components than by reusing objects. We also examine whether the influence of component or object reuse on modeling performance is moderated by prior experience in systems analysis and design. We evaluate the representational constructs of the two based on a set of decomposition characteristics, and postulate hypotheses comparing the two based on theories in cognitive psychology and human factors. We find that models generated by reusing business components are of higher accuracy than those developed by reusing objects. An interesting finding of our study is that \\{IT\\} professionals who are less experienced in systems analysis and design perform on par with experienced professionals, when modeling business systems by reusing components. We argue that the decomposition characteristics of components--with respect to granularity, quality, and focus--enable less experienced analysts to perform on par with more experienced analysts.

For cognitive radio applications in particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent OFDM-based standards such as \\{IEEE\\} 802.11p for vehicular communication and \\{IEEE\\} 802.11af for \\{TV\\} whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a single basic channel without violating \\{SEM\\} specifications. The proposed method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict \\{RF\\} filter requirements, allowing the \\{RF\\} subsystem to be implemented using much less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions.

We argue that production lines are key enablers in organizational agility and any hostile and drifting behaviour could turn potential opportunities into losses besides the fact that an agile \\{EIS\\} is well integrated. There are many \\{ISs\\} developed to control and monitor the drifting behaviour of production lines like fault detection and classification (FDC), statistical process control (SPC) and automation systems. These offer excellent detection mechanisms against known drifts; however, real challenge lies in carrying out root-cause analysis for unknown drifts. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new category of \\{IS\\} for production lines as agile PLIS, capable to control, detect, assess and predict the potential drifts for proactive measures. The definition of an agile \\{IS\\} for production line is proposed with quality attributes selected from literature, \\{ISO\\} 91261 software quality standard and specificities of the production line. Further, generic measures of production line agility as local (LAI) and global (GAI) agility indices are proposed to measure the agility drifts for a production line. The agility in an \\{IS\\} is built and not designed; therefore, we also present a compliance matrix of most widely used information system architectures (ISA) against proposed agile \\{PLIS\\} with quality attributes. This paper concludes by validating the proposed quantified measures of agility for agile \\{PLIS\\} using data from reputed semiconductor manufacturer.

Every good user story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding the context of a user story. Objective We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making use of business process models. The method associates user stories with the corresponding business process model activity element. Method We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process model can be used to infer information about the execution order and integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of association granularity: a user story can be more abstract, approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of these three levels. Results Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of user stories when associated business process models are available. Conclusions We addressed a problem which arises from managing user stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing context of a user story. Our method contributes to the discipline of conceptual modeling in agile development. Our experiment provides empirical insight into requirement dependencies.

Particularly, electric cars represent this case and complexity is not only driven by product variants, but also by an increasing proportion and importance of software applications in value creation. However, the reference processes to develop these automotive products were established two decades ago. The reference process which is used by automotive \\{OEMs\\} is the integrated product and process development which bases on the concept of simultaneous engineering. In contrast to conventional cars with a combustion engine, product architectures for electric vehicles can be planned differently with the lithium-ion battery as the central and most expensive component and can be designed with more degrees of freedom. Such a product architecture can also be simplified that complexity is reduced for both, the product and the development process. Changes in terms of product architecture also imply that there are changes in the technological knowledge of the automotive OEM. It must focus on key technologies. Consequently, suppliers have got the chance to advance from suppliers, who produce products on demand, to technological experts, who provide technology platforms. The development process, moreover, has to evolve from typical stage-gate-concepts to a more agile process tailored to suit continuously changing requirements to fulfil the demand for a fast product qualification for series production. So, even shorter innovation cycles and time-to-market periods can be reached. Certainly, this has an effect on financial aspects with the objective to design the organisational process as lean as possible. Finally, the more agile process design serves an optimised ratio between engineering expenses and customer value - called Return on Engineering. It is the central paradigm to which process design and methods for product development need to adhere.

The introduction of procedural code sets for whole-exome and genome sequencing is a milestone toward financially sustainable clinical implementation; however, achieving reimbursement is currently a major challenge. As part of a prospective quality-improvement initiative to implement the new code sets, we adopted Agile, a development methodology originally devised in software development. We implemented eight functionally distinct modules (request review, cost estimation, preauthorization, accessioning, prebilling, testing, reporting, and reimbursement consultation) and obtained feedback via an anonymous survey. We managed 50 clinical requests (January to June 2015). The fraction of pursued-to-requested cases (n = 15/50; utilization management fraction, 0.3) aimed for a high rate of preauthorizations. In 13 of 15 patients the insurance plan required preauthorization, which we obtained in 70% and ultimately achieved reimbursement in 50%. Interoperability enabled assessment of 12 different combinations of modules that underline the importance of an adaptive workflow and policy tailoring to achieve higher yields of reimbursement. The survey confirmed a positive attitude toward self-organizing teams. We acknowledge the individuals and their interactions and termed the infrastructure: human pipeline.

Driven successively by concurrent engineering, collaborative product design in the virtual enterprise or digital behavorial aircraft, it was capitalize through the establishment of a federative interoperability framework. Driven by factory of the future-related research, the dynamic manufacturing network (DMN) concept enriched the framework, which aims at providing agile infrastructure for networked collaborative product development. For such networks, protocols based on open eBusiness product lifecycle management (PLM) standards for exchange and sharing of product and process data between the implied organizations, their processes and the technical enteprise applications supporting these processes are needed This paper presents a new way of combining model-based enterprise platform engineering, model-driven architecture, and system engineering in order to adress the establishment of a sustainable interoperability within DMN. Based on relevant litterature interoperability issues, this paper describes the new approach, which relies on the association of effective existing technologies coupled with research results on the fields of model-driven engineering (MDE), enterprise interoperability, system engineering and PLM. The new approach relies on the concept of digital factory system (DFS) coupled with \\{DMN\\} in order to produce sustainable and agile collaborative infrastructure for manufacturing digital ebusiness ecosystem.

The need for such features currently prevent the exploitation of reconfigurable robotics in manufacturing. The current work presents an approach to design and configure reconfigurable robots for the high precision manufacturing industry. The work proposes a configuration algorithm that enables the identification of the robot architectures and the related reconfigurability features by selecting the type and number of robot modules to be implemented over time in order to better accomplish a number of production requirements. Particularly, assuming the robot will work by utilising a finite set of robotic modules, the algorithm determines the set of modules to form the arm and the ones to be allocated in the robot storage for possible usage over time. Results show a number of benefits such as a robotic chain with customised reaching and degrees of freedom with a reduced cost by performing an accurate module selection and configuration; this should lead the robot users to prefer reconfigurable robots to commercial rigid catalogue solutions proposed by robot manufacturers.

Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in flight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of flight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-specific responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and flight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p &lt; 0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and flight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efficiently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.

One way for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to become more agile, is to incorporate industrial robots in their production processes; larger enterprises already use this versatile piece of equipment for large batch sizes. To do so, a new perspective and approach is required, tailored to dynamic manufacturing systems in which production systems and components can be easily reconfigured, altered, swapped or replaced. A modular system architecture was developed within project \\{SInBot\\} upon which challenges in dynamic cooperation between robots and humans were projected. The developed system uses decentralized control and distributed intelligence, linked through an extensible, flexible, and fault-tolerant communication architecture. The rapidly growing complexity of traditional systems is compared to its decentralized counterpart to illustrate some of the many advantages of this new system architecture. A manufacturing scenario analogue is discussed and the approach to verify the performance of inner-system components, as well as the benefits of this approach. Key challenges that are encountered in implementing the cooperation into the current industrial environments are identified and projected upon the verification system.

Volatile and uncertain renewable energy sources cause high fluctuations in electricity prices and thus usually higher costs for the final user such as a melt shop. This paper presents an integrated production and electricity optimization system that can help the melt shop to adjust its production schedule to volatile electricity prices and thus lower its costs. An existing production scheduling optimization system based on a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming model has been further developed to account for electricity costs as well. It deploys an intelligent heuristics which decomposes the overall optimization problem into several sub-problems of smaller size in order to achieve faster and more robust solution. The electricity-aware optimization system has been successfully tested and implemented in a melt shop where it managed to reduce electricity costs by around 3%. At the same time, the system has improved coordination between different production stages, and thus made the entire melt shop more flexible, agile and responsive to unexpected events. The system has also been recognized as a very useful tool for running various simulations, what-if analysis and business scenarios on the melt shop in order to identify bottlenecks and further increase its production rate.

However, this activity may be misleading when a test suite is insufficiently robust for revealing faults. Particularly, refactoring faults can be tricky and difficult to detect. Coverage analysis is a standard practice to evaluate fault detection capability of test suites. However, there is usually a low correlation between coverage and fault detection. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on the use of coverage data of mostly impacted code elements to identify shortcomings in a test suite. We consider three real open source projects and their original test suites. The results show that a test suite not directly calling the refactored method and/or its callers increases the chance of missing the fault. Additional analysis of branch coverage on test cases shows that there are higher chances of detecting a refactoring fault when branch coverage is high. These results give evidence that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by refactoring edits. Furthermore, we propose a statistic model that evidences the correlation of coverage over certain code elements and the suite's capability of revealing refactoring faults.

Analysis is based on the view that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are interdependent. The fundamental importance of sequential interdependencies in seafood production is demonstrated. The four subcases are first analysed individually, applying relational contracting theory to understand patterns of exchange leading to transfer of title at markets. Developed relationships and trust, but also an acceptance of partner switching, characterizes exchange in all four market-related subcases. An understanding of how these loosely coupled markets may be viewed as aligned is developed. Markets emerge as nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange facilitate agile seafood distribution.

Furthermore, the \\{UAV\\} can land and takeoff from any orientation and come into contact with objects without putting the propellers at risk. Flaps at the base of the sphere will generate roll and pitch moments as opposed to conventional swash plate designs while the coaxial setup will provide the necessary yaw moments and increase in thrust to volume ratio of the system. The flaps, placed below the propellers allow for decoupled roll and pitch control in a thrust vectoring manner. The final result of this design is a well-protected, compact, easily controlled, flexible and agile \\{UAV\\} for operations in complex environments. The spherical \\{UAV\\} was successfully flight tested on a number of occasions with various \\{PD\\} and u-synthesis robust control systems and was observed to be easily stabilised and resistant to external disturbances to certain extent.

The importance of patient preferences and values increases in shared decision making especially when the cost of cancer care is continuing its steep rise. As our understanding of cancer systems biology increases, we are justifiably optimistic about therapeutic improvements but recognize that this has complicated the traditional Food and Drug Administration approval of drug indications based on organ-specific cancer for a particular drug. Dynamic and agile clinical guidelines that reflect a rapidly changing knowledge base for decision-making support are needed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has been working on three initiatives to tackle these complex issues. The first initiative is ASCO's collaboration with other international organizations to create a framework to assess drugs for the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List, including nongenerics. The second initiative aims to define clinically meaningful outcomes as precision medicine expands the definition of cancers, leading to increased demand for the use of targeted drugs as single agents or in combination. The third initiative is ASCO's value framework, published in 2015, focusing on patient-physician shared decision making. The framework incorporates three parameters: 1) the meaningfulness of the clinical benefit, 2) the toxicity of the treatment, and 3) the patient's financial out-of-pocket cost. \\{ASCO\\} is concerned about the rising cost of cancer care when the clinical complexity and the pace of change in oncology are accelerating, and it is committed to help improve patient outcomes and value in cancer care as well as to engage the broader health care community in a process of collaborative improvement.

This highly distributed computing environment can be used to provide ultra-low latency, precise positional awareness and agile applications, which could significantly improve user experience. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to consider next-generation paradigms such as Information-Centric Networking and Cloud Computing, integrated with the upcoming 5th Generation networking access. A cohesive end-to-end architecture is proposed, fully exploiting Information-Centric Networking together with the Mobile Follow-Me Cloud approach, for enhancing the migration of content-caches located at the edge of cloudified mobile networks. The chosen content-relocation algorithm attains content-availability improvements of up to 500% when a mobile user performs a request and compared against other existing solutions. The performed evaluation considers a realistic core-network, with functional and non-functional measurements, including the deployment of the entire system, computation and allocation/migration of resources. The achieved results reveal that the proposed architecture is beneficial not only from the users' perspective but also from the providers point-of-view, which may be able to optimize their resources and reach significant bandwidth savings.

Agile practices emphasize frequent releases with the help of an automated toolchain from code to delivery. Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery, what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to customers. Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering delivery activities. Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used tools, such as \\{UI\\} testing and performance testing, were more distinctly missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current workflows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were able to deploy software more rapidly. Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals of the case organizations.

Although communication is key in the exchange of information between team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, \\{IT\\} infrastructure, etc.) and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic. Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD. The research question to which this study responds concerns how development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members, communication of the status of the development process, and communication of the status of the progress of the product under development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository tools, with information from the process development and product characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share information about the status of the project/process/product during the development process in order to overcome some of the still existing problems in communication in AGSD.

It relies on the analysis of an original, qualitative study of agile software development teams, which operate in an environment characterized by the simultaneous implementation of interdependent organizational routines. We argue that the interdependencies among routines are seized by organizational members who manipulate the level of 'protection' that each routine is granted (i.e. the enforcement of adherence to the routine). Less protection permits flexibility, whereas more protection creates stability. We observe that 'protection' can be exerted along two different, yet related, dimensions: content of the routine and performance of the routine. The interplay of these two dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility.

Agile methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of teams on the same development programme. Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories used in the development process. Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews, supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in data analysis. Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance. It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to specific activities within each of the agile roles. Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding ceremonies.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software size measurement approaches more, or use different software development methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in small versus large companies? Objective Our objective is to get an understanding into the cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific demographic (e.g., small versus large companies). Thus, we decided to conduct an exploratory study in this area and collected real industrial data in the context of Turkey which has a vibrant software industry. Method To achieve the above objective, we use the data from a recent Turkish-wide survey of software engineering practices which was systematically designed with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian context and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). 202 practicing software engineers participated in the survey. We raise a set of 12 research questions about the cross-factor correlation of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics, and address them using statistical analysis. Results The exploratory study results reveal important and interesting findings about cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics. Among some of the most interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and \\{SE\\} tasks; (2) Almost 55% of participants measure software size; (3) Agile/lean development is used the least (16%) by the participants working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4) Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small-sized companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme programming practices decreases. Conclusion The results of this exploratory study will be useful to software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and challenging experiences in using \\{SE\\} tools?, and (3) Why is Agile/lean development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how these approaches could be utilized more frequently.

We got inspired by the Agile Manifesto which set an important reference point to the software community, addressing primarily innovation in the software development process. We propose a similar approach to Antifragility, namely we would like to define the principles ruling the building up of software systems which exploit faults and errors to become better and stronger. This Manifesto does not want to be a fixed and complete set of principles. It is an open contribution to the discussion which needs to be improved and re-elaborated.

While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. Objective We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. Method We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. Results The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. Conclusions The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering. Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of change.

Considering that instrumental approaches for project management are not sufficient for a flexible and uncertain product as software, the project success depends on how software project managers deal with the problems and make decisions. Different from the normative decision theory, which focus on how decisions should be made in order to be rational, the descriptive decision theory focus on how decisions are actually made and includes the naturalistic decision making models. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper aims to synthetize empirical studies published on journals and conferences proceedings that analyze the decision-making phenomenon in the software project management context from a naturalistic perspective. The search were conducted in five search engines: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, \\{IEEE\\} Xplore, and \\{ACM\\} Digital Library. The 27 selected papers were categorized and then synthesized into a thematic map. The categories included: agile development practices, stakeholders involvement, escalation and de-escalation of commitment factors, participatory decision-making, communication, use of rational methods, emotion, and cognitive biases. The results indicate that more studies are needed to better understand the decision-making phenomenon from this perspective.

For the benefit of academia and industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken. Objective This paper investigates two research questions: what challenges do agile practitioners face? and, how do practitioner challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify implications for research that is relevant to practice. Method A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to previous publications. Results Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under 27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation, sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which were inter-related. Over 50% of survey respondents experienced challenges highlighted in the case study. Conclusion The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such as governance and contracts, are under-researched, while others, such as business and \\{IT\\} transformation, have been researched but findings have not had the expected impact. Researchers wishing to address practitioner challenges need to treat them in context rather than in isolation and improve knowledge transfer.

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering for students' individual learning characteristics. To address this issue, learning styles become effective to understand students' different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the students' learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting students' learning style. Test results corroborate that students' outcomes improved when receiving the strategy that match their learning styles. Our data highlight opportunities for improving software engineering education by considering the students' learning preferences.

A case study of three industrial cases was carried out to understand how to tailor agile methods effectively including also hardware development. Agile practices, mostly derived from Scrum, were tailored to fit the needs of each team and the method development was closely followed. Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were compared and complemented with interviews to understand the new working methods and their effects. Case evidence shows that interdependencies between work of each developer were taken into account better, visibility over the whole product increased and need for internal documentation diminished due to improved communication, but dividing hardware tasks into iterations was experienced difficult. With some tailoring, agile practices are beneficial also in the embedded system development. To successfully adopt agile methods into embedded system development, the team must consist of all the project members, the natural cycle lengths of different disciplines and different knowledge between the developers must be accepted and built upon, and the progress of the product must be presented or visualized in the end of each iteration.

As a response, agile software development and modular acquisition approaches, new independent organizational units equipped with fast reacting teams, in combination with a series of policy changes are developed to address the need to innovate digital service delivery in government. This article uses a process tracing approach, as well as initial qualitative interviews with a subset of executives and agency-level digital services members to provide an overview of the existing policies and implementation approaches toward an agile innovation management approach. The article then provides a research framework including research questions that provide guidance for future research on the managerial implementation considerations necessary to scale up the initial efforts and move toward a collaborative and agile innovation management approach in government.

The new paradigm greatly applies to military vehicles for the radical improvement of tactical and operational mobility. This article presents a new technological paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics that is studied as an extremely fast and exact response of the tire-soil couple to (i) the tire dynamic loading, (ii) transient changes of gripping and rolling resistance conditions on uniform stochastic terrains and (iii) rapid transient changes from one uniform terrain to a different uniform terrain. Tire longitudinal relaxation lengths are analyzed to characterize the longitudinal relaxation time constants. A set of agile characteristics is also considered to analyze agile tire slippage dynamics within a time interval that is close to the tire longitudinal relaxation time constants. The presented paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics lays out a foundation to radically enhance vehicle terrain mobility by controlling the tire slippage in its transient phases to prevent the immobilization of a vehicle. Control development basis and requirements for implementing an agile tire slippage control are also analyzed and considered.

Currently, such evidence exists in the form of success stores and case studies, mostly of qualitative nature. Objective: Provide a metrics model to quantitatively measure the impact of an agile transformation in a software development organization. Method: The metrics model was elicited with the use of the Goal Question Metric approach. Results: A quantitative metrics model containing eight rigorously described metrics is presented and followed by its application to evaluate an agile and lean transformation in a large international telecommunication organization with 350 employees in two sites. Conclusions: The metrics model was sensitive to the changes that occurred in the organization and revealed significant improvements in six of the eight metrics and a deterioration in one of the metrics.

One of the reasons for poor performance was assigned to project complexity. A combination of lean construction and agile project management are hypothesized as a possible solution to cope with project complexity. In this paper we aim to understand if the implicit usage of lean and agile help coping with complexity. The research was done by means of correlation analysis on data gathered from a structured questionnaire (67 responses). In total, 51 significant correlations among 255 possible relations were found. To reduce the number of variables, factor analysis was performed. Correlation analysis on the defined factors showed 8 significant correlations among 25 relations. Several lean and agile elements were shown to significantly correlate to either reducing complexity or managing complexity. It was therefore concluded that these are promising to cope with complexity and improve project performance, which is to be confirmed in subsequent research.

Volatile requirements and complex interdependencies are the main challenges which agile methods originating from software development are designed for. To examine transferability of several agile methods to the predevelopment of hardware, the authors first theoretically analysed existing methods regarding their potential. While adopting the most promising methods, a case study regarding the production technology for electrical energy storage systems was conducted. It showed that many agile aspects and tools are easily adoptable and help developers in the early stage depending on group size and complexity. They contribute by ensuring that complexity remains manageable, encouraging close teamwork, improving information circulation and supporting transparency. Thus agile methods supplement concurrent predevelopment.

Increasing tough and competitive situations at demand-side have led the stakeholders of power system to reform, because people are more informed and can make decisions that has given rise to turbulent and volatile electricity markets. In such highly diversified and open market environment, the integrated control strategy has expedited the concept of Demand Response. Currently, the important questions in the area of demand response are likely to shift from whether to adopt dynamic pricing to how to achieve fast demand response by the combination of technology and a competitive retail electricity market. This paper assembles the part and parcel in the light of existing technologies for the development of the concept of agility in demand response, that can play a role as a service package which is designed to meet the customer satisfaction efficiently and reliably as well as improve the market responsiveness. For the first time, this paper encompasses the concept of Agile Demand Response that is defined as the ability of power system to survive and prosper in the competitive retail market by reacting to the market needs fast and effectively which are driven by the customers. This paper also presents the key enablers of the agile demand response, which are (1) Retail Market, (2) Virtual Supply-demand matching mechanism, (3) Integrated information system and (4) Stay Committed. The paper concludes that by bringing the enablers together - Agile \\{DR\\} improves the responsiveness to the retail market changes unambiguously.

When traditional sequential development processes are employed the high degree of uncertainty connected to these innovations results in a long and costly development time, potentially leading to failure of the project. The paper at hand recommends highly iterative prototyping processes based on findings from the software industry where agile processes, mostly Scrum, are widely employed. In the development of physical products, prototyping is often unsystematic which is considered as a major obstacle to an efficient agile development process. This paper presents a systematic method of prototyping in the context of physical product development in order to gradually reduce the high degree of market and technological uncertainty associated with radical innovations. The prioritization of requirements is suggested to be the basis for the design of adequate prototypes. An analytical information-oriented approach is presented that continuously takes into account the amount of uncertainty in the dimensions market, product and process. The evaluation of the specific ratio of benefit and effort connected to the implementation of the requirements leads to their prioritization.

In this context, a comprehensive description (ontology) of involved components has a high significance. If certain technological aspects are missing during a production process, the production control should respond in a dynamic, versatile and adaptive (agile) manner to the overall value network. The possibility to describe the requirements of products for the necessary processes in the same namespace like the requirements of the necessary processes for the resources is a prerequisite to enable this behavior. Afterwards the different requirements will be placed in relation to the respective requirements. The aim is to define the necessary processes for the production based on the description of the product and the known resources in an agile way.

The participants in the focus groups confirmed the causality between the intervention actions and the observed delivery improvement. The empirical results show that the intervention actions, packaged in the governance framework, enable codependent sets of Scrum teams to deliver faster.

A further pilot showed how it could be extended to meet the longer term needs of triage training and ensure better quality assurance. In the longer term it may have the potential to improve compliance with International Health Regulations, be adapted for future emergencies, and contribute to global health security.

The smart factory approach and the research and development pursuit of the fourth industrial revolution necessitate the refurbishment and upgrade of already existing manufacturing systems and the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in automation systems in order to achieve a holistic, company-wide information exchange and a pervasive traceability of product and manufacturing data. According to this approach, previous programmable logical controls (PLC), established business intelligence solutions and existing manufacturing execution systems (MES) with mutually lacking interfaces are integrated into a new ecosystem for planning, executing and analysis applications. Due to the fact that each system persists on its own user interface, the implementation has to be strongly coupled to a user centered design of innovative human machine interfaces, joined into one distributed, networked application. In this paper, an agile information processing framework for foundry purposes is presented. Every underlying application is accessible via web-based user interfaces providing control of each single system. This leads into a service orientated architecture triggering the individual underlying systems as services, which are connected using web communication technology to exchange data along a shared information model. The data storage is modular to ensure scalability and interoperability with other manufacturing departments. During the actual manufacturing process, different services like inline data mining analysis are deployed and the results are visualized in user demanded dashboards and reports. For new requirements in business intelligence and \\{MES\\} the developed interfaces are provided in a unique library and a content management system. The described architecture enhances the development of new information applications, accelerates the planning and execution process and is completely orientated to the demands of users, as fast planning procedures and analysis driven user interfaces.

Yet many organizations are unable to adapt effectively or quickly due to the established institutional arrangements and patterns of decision-making and governance. Adaptive governance should enhance the capacity of an organization to deal with and adapt to changes, while protecting the same organization from becoming unstable. Strategies of adaptive governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities, decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for governments. This means that adaptive governance implies a 'balancing act', and a reliance on ambidextrous strategies. The aim of this editorial is to introduce the concept of adaptive governance and discuss its implications for governments in the digital age.

Method We asked 63 Norwegian software professionals, representing both the client and the provider role, to report information about their last completed project. In a follow-up survey with 64 Norwegian software professionals, we addressed selected findings from the first survey. Results The analysis of the project information showed the following: i) The project management triangle criteria of being on time, on budget, and having the specified functionality are poor correlates of the essential success dimension client benefits. ii) Benefit management planning before the project started and benefit management activities during project execution were connected with success in delivering client benefits. iii) Fixed-price projects and projects in which the selection of providers had a strong focus on low price were less successful in delivering project benefits than other projects. iv) Agile projects were in general more successful than other projects, but agile projects without flexible scope to reflect changed user needs and learning, or without frequent delivery to the client, had less than average success in delivering client benefits. Conclusions The software projects that were successful in delivering client benefits differed from the less successful ones in several ways. In particular, they applied benefit management practices during project execution, they avoided fixed-price contracts, they had less focus on low price in the selection of providers, and they applied the core agile practices - frequent delivery to the client and scope flexibility.

In particular, Scrum is an agile process framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11 companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns. The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum, and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where available, we have included company recommendations regarding the deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum concepts.

It provides an attractive alternative to more established development methods such as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). Given the growing demands for using agile methods for software development, we examine if systems analysts are more effective at modeling business systems by reusing business components than by reusing objects. We also examine whether the influence of component or object reuse on modeling performance is moderated by prior experience in systems analysis and design. We evaluate the representational constructs of the two based on a set of decomposition characteristics, and postulate hypotheses comparing the two based on theories in cognitive psychology and human factors. We find that models generated by reusing business components are of higher accuracy than those developed by reusing objects. An interesting finding of our study is that \\{IT\\} professionals who are less experienced in systems analysis and design perform on par with experienced professionals, when modeling business systems by reusing components. We argue that the decomposition characteristics of components--with respect to granularity, quality, and focus--enable less experienced analysts to perform on par with more experienced analysts.

For cognitive radio applications in particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent OFDM-based standards such as \\{IEEE\\} 802.11p for vehicular communication and \\{IEEE\\} 802.11af for \\{TV\\} whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a single basic channel without violating \\{SEM\\} specifications. The proposed method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict \\{RF\\} filter requirements, allowing the \\{RF\\} subsystem to be implemented using much less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions.

There are many \\{ISs\\} developed to control and monitor the drifting behaviour of production lines like fault detection and classification (FDC), statistical process control (SPC) and automation systems. These offer excellent detection mechanisms against known drifts; however, real challenge lies in carrying out root-cause analysis for unknown drifts.

The definition of an agile \\{IS\\} for production line is proposed with quality attributes selected from literature, \\{ISO\\} 91261 software quality standard and specificities of the production line. Further, generic measures of production line agility as local (LAI) and global (GAI) agility indices are proposed to measure the agility drifts for a production line.

Every good user story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding the context of a user story. Objective We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making use of business process models. The method associates user stories with the corresponding business process model activity element. Method We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process model can be used to infer information about the execution order and integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of association granularity: a user story can be more abstract, approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of these three levels. Results Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of user stories when associated business process models are available. Conclusions We addressed a problem which arises from managing user stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing context of a user story. Our method contributes to the discipline of conceptual modeling in agile development. Our experiment provides empirical insight into requirement dependencies.

Using three case studies, our research uncovers two high-functioning control patterns - one with traditional characteristics and one with agile characteristics - that demonstrate positive alignment among the control environment, control mechanisms, socio-emotional behaviors, and execution of controls. By better understanding the circumstances that contribute to control conflicts, organizations can be increasingly mindful of cultivating a complementary relationship among the control dimensions when designing, implementing, monitoring and adjusting controls within \\{IS\\} processes.

Particularly, electric cars represent this case and complexity is not only driven by product variants, but also by an increasing proportion and importance of software applications in value creation. However, the reference processes to develop these automotive products were established two decades ago. The reference process which is used by automotive \\{OEMs\\} is the integrated product and process development which bases on the concept of simultaneous engineering. In contrast to conventional cars with a combustion engine, product architectures for electric vehicles can be planned differently with the lithium-ion battery as the central and most expensive component and can be designed with more degrees of freedom. Such a product architecture can also be simplified that complexity is reduced for both, the product and the development process. Changes in terms of product architecture also imply that there are changes in the technological knowledge of the automotive OEM. It must focus on key technologies. Consequently, suppliers have got the chance to advance from suppliers, who produce products on demand, to technological experts, who provide technology platforms. The development process, moreover, has to evolve from typical stage-gate-concepts to a more agile process tailored to suit continuously changing requirements to fulfil the demand for a fast product qualification for series production. So, even shorter innovation cycles and time-to-market periods can be reached. Certainly, this has an effect on financial aspects with the objective to design the organisational process as lean as possible. Finally, the more agile process design serves an optimised ratio between engineering expenses and customer value - called Return on Engineering. It is the central paradigm to which process design and methods for product development need to adhere.

The introduction of procedural code sets for whole-exome and genome sequencing is a milestone toward financially sustainable clinical implementation; however, achieving reimbursement is currently a major challenge. As part of a prospective quality-improvement initiative to implement the new code sets, we adopted Agile, a development methodology originally devised in software development. We implemented eight functionally distinct modules (request review, cost estimation, preauthorization, accessioning, prebilling, testing, reporting, and reimbursement consultation) and obtained feedback via an anonymous survey. We managed 50 clinical requests (January to June 2015). The fraction of pursued-to-requested cases (n = 15/50; utilization management fraction, 0.3) aimed for a high rate of preauthorizations. In 13 of 15 patients the insurance plan required preauthorization, which we obtained in 70% and ultimately achieved reimbursement in 50%. Interoperability enabled assessment of 12 different combinations of modules that underline the importance of an adaptive workflow and policy tailoring to achieve higher yields of reimbursement. The survey confirmed a positive attitude toward self-organizing teams. We acknowledge the individuals and their interactions and termed the infrastructure: human pipeline. Nontechnical barriers currently are limiting the scope and availability of clinical genomic sequencing. The presented human pipeline is one approach toward long-term financial sustainability of clinical genomics.

The need for such features currently prevent the exploitation of reconfigurable robotics in manufacturing. The current work presents an approach to design and configure reconfigurable robots for the high precision manufacturing industry. The work proposes a configuration algorithm that enables the identification of the robot architectures and the related reconfigurability features by selecting the type and number of robot modules to be implemented over time in order to better accomplish a number of production requirements. Particularly, assuming the robot will work by utilising a finite set of robotic modules, the algorithm determines the set of modules to form the arm and the ones to be allocated in the robot storage for possible usage over time. Results show a number of benefits such as a robotic chain with customised reaching and degrees of freedom with a reduced cost by performing an accurate module selection and configuration; this should lead the robot users to prefer reconfigurable robots to commercial rigid catalogue solutions proposed by robot manufacturers.

Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in flight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of flight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-specific responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and flight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p &lt; 0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and flight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efficiently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.

Companies are pushed to respond quickly and cost-efficient to changing markets. One way for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to become more agile, is to incorporate industrial robots in their production processes; larger enterprises already use this versatile piece of equipment for large batch sizes. To do so, a new perspective and approach is required, tailored to dynamic manufacturing systems in which production systems and components can be easily reconfigured, altered, swapped or replaced. A modular system architecture was developed within project \\{SInBot\\} upon which challenges in dynamic cooperation between robots and humans were projected. The developed system uses decentralized control and distributed intelligence, linked through an extensible, flexible, and fault-tolerant communication architecture. The rapidly growing complexity of traditional systems is compared to its decentralized counterpart to illustrate some of the many advantages of this new system architecture. A manufacturing scenario analogue is discussed and the approach to verify the performance of inner-system components, as well as the benefits of this approach. Key challenges that are encountered in implementing the cooperation into the current industrial environments are identified and projected upon the verification system.

Volatile and uncertain renewable energy sources cause high fluctuations in electricity prices and thus usually higher costs for the final user such as a melt shop. This paper presents an integrated production and electricity optimization system that can help the melt shop to adjust its production schedule to volatile electricity prices and thus lower its costs. An existing production scheduling optimization system based on a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming model has been further developed to account for electricity costs as well. It deploys an intelligent heuristics which decomposes the overall optimization problem into several sub-problems of smaller size in order to achieve faster and more robust solution. The electricity-aware optimization system has been successfully tested and implemented in a melt shop where it managed to reduce electricity costs by around 3%. At the same time, the system has improved coordination between different production stages, and thus made the entire melt shop more flexible, agile and responsive to unexpected events. The system has also been recognized as a very useful tool for running various simulations, what-if analysis and business scenarios on the melt shop in order to identify bottlenecks and further increase its production rate.

However, this activity may be misleading when a test suite is insufficiently robust for revealing faults. Particularly, refactoring faults can be tricky and difficult to detect. Coverage analysis is a standard practice to evaluate fault detection capability of test suites. However, there is usually a low correlation between coverage and fault detection. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on the use of coverage data of mostly impacted code elements to identify shortcomings in a test suite. We consider three real open source projects and their original test suites. The results show that a test suite not directly calling the refactored method and/or its callers increases the chance of missing the fault. Additional analysis of branch coverage on test cases shows that there are higher chances of detecting a refactoring fault when branch coverage is high. These results give evidence that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by refactoring edits. Furthermore, we propose a statistic model that evidences the correlation of coverage over certain code elements and the suite's capability of revealing refactoring faults.

A case study in seafood production is analysed from an end-to-end perspective in the flow of seafood from Norway to Japan to investigate how practitioners describe trading and the terminology used on trading embedded across the complete supply network. Four subcases that focus on how goods are traded are studied. Two subcases consider raw material supply, aquaculture-supplied salmon and wild-caught pelagic fish. The third subcase concerns the export of frozen mackerel to Japan, and the final subcase concerns seafood trading at a regional wholesale market in Japan. Analysis is based on the view that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are interdependent. The fundamental importance of sequential interdependencies in seafood production is demonstrated. The four subcases are first analysed individually, applying relational contracting theory to understand patterns of exchange leading to transfer of title at markets. Developed relationships and trust, but also an acceptance of partner switching, characterizes exchange in all four market-related subcases. An understanding of how these loosely coupled markets may be viewed as aligned is developed. Markets emerge as nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange facilitate agile seafood distribution.

The importance of patient preferences and values increases in shared decision making especially when the cost of cancer care is continuing its steep rise. As our understanding of cancer systems biology increases, we are justifiably optimistic about therapeutic improvements but recognize that this has complicated the traditional Food and Drug Administration approval of drug indications based on organ-specific cancer for a particular drug. Dynamic and agile clinical guidelines that reflect a rapidly changing knowledge base for decision-making support are needed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has been working on three initiatives to tackle these complex issues. The first initiative is ASCO's collaboration with other international organizations to create a framework to assess drugs for the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List, including nongenerics. The second initiative aims to define clinically meaningful outcomes as precision medicine expands the definition of cancers, leading to increased demand for the use of targeted drugs as single agents or in combination. The third initiative is ASCO's value framework, published in 2015, focusing on patient-physician shared decision making. The framework incorporates three parameters: 1) the meaningfulness of the clinical benefit, 2) the toxicity of the treatment, and 3) the patient's financial out-of-pocket cost. \\{ASCO\\} is concerned about the rising cost of cancer care when the clinical complexity and the pace of change in oncology are accelerating, and it is committed to help improve patient outcomes and value in cancer care as well as to engage the broader health care community in a process of collaborative improvement.

This highly distributed computing environment can be used to provide ultra-low latency, precise positional awareness and agile applications, which could significantly improve user experience. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to consider next-generation paradigms such as Information-Centric Networking and Cloud Computing, integrated with the upcoming 5th Generation networking access. A cohesive end-to-end architecture is proposed, fully exploiting Information-Centric Networking together with the Mobile Follow-Me Cloud approach, for enhancing the migration of content-caches located at the edge of cloudified mobile networks. The chosen content-relocation algorithm attains content-availability improvements of up to 500% when a mobile user performs a request and compared against other existing solutions. The performed evaluation considers a realistic core-network, with functional and non-functional measurements, including the deployment of the entire system, computation and allocation/migration of resources. The achieved results reveal that the proposed architecture is beneficial not only from the users' perspective but also from the providers point-of-view, which may be able to optimize their resources and reach significant bandwidth savings.

Agile practices emphasize frequent releases with the help of an automated toolchain from code to delivery. Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery, what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to customers. Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering delivery activities. Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used tools, such as \\{UI\\} testing and performance testing, were more distinctly missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current workflows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were able to deploy software more rapidly. Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals of the case organizations. Still, a well-founded toolchain supports speedy delivery of new software.

Although communication is key in the exchange of information between team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, \\{IT\\} infrastructure, etc.) and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic. Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD. The research question to which this study responds concerns how development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members, communication of the status of the development process, and communication of the status of the progress of the product under development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository tools, with information from the process development and product characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share information about the status of the project/process/product during the development process in order to overcome some of the still existing problems in communication in AGSD.

It relies on the analysis of an original, qualitative study of agile software development teams, which operate in an environment characterized by the simultaneous implementation of interdependent organizational routines. We argue that the interdependencies among routines are seized by organizational members who manipulate the level of 'protection' that each routine is granted (i.e. the enforcement of adherence to the routine). Less protection permits flexibility, whereas more protection creates stability. We observe that 'protection' can be exerted along two different, yet related, dimensions: content of the routine and performance of the routine. The interplay of these two dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility.

Agile methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of teams on the same development programme. Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories used in the development process. Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews, supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in data analysis. Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance. It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to specific activities within each of the agile roles. Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding ceremonies.

Method: A systematic review has been conducted. Synthesis has been done using grounded-theory based coding procedures. Results: Through thematic analysis we identified 10 challenge themes and 17 best practice themes. A key outcome was the inventory of best practices, the most common ones recommended in different contexts were to hold regular workshops and seminars with industry, assure continuous learning from industry and academic sides, ensure management engagement, the need for a champion, basing research on real-world problems, showing explicit benefits to the industry partner, be agile during the collaboration, and the co-location of the researcher on the industry side. Conclusion: Given the importance of industry-academia collaboration to conduct research of high practical relevance we provide a synthesis of challenges and best practices, which can be used by researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions on how to structure their collaborations.

Objective: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize research about the most relevant approaches addressing the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were classified according to the phase of the development cycle they addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations. Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing issues related to different phases of the software development cycle for ubiquitous systems. Most approaches have been aimed at addressing the implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others phases such as testing need more attention from researchers. Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting case studies to make the studies more reproducible and closer to real life cases.

In this tertiary study, 13 secondary studies were included for detailed analysis. Given the heterogeneity of the data, we were unable to perform a rigorous synthesis. Instead, we mapped the identified Agile and Lean practices, and their impacts on the project constraints described in PMBOK. From 13 secondary studies, we identified 13 Agile and Lean practices. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is studied in ten secondary studies, meanwhile other practices are studied in only one or two secondary studies. This tertiary study provides a consolidated view of the impacts of Agile and Lean practices. The result of this tertiary study indicates that \\{TDD\\} has a positive impact on external quality. However, due to insufficient data or contradictory results, we were unable to make inferences on other Agile and Lean practices.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software size measurement approaches more, or use different software development methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in small versus large companies? Objective Our objective is to get an understanding into the cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific demographic (e.g., small versus large companies). Thus, we decided to conduct an exploratory study in this area and collected real industrial data in the context of Turkey which has a vibrant software industry. Method To achieve the above objective, we use the data from a recent Turkish-wide survey of software engineering practices which was systematically designed with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian context and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). 202 practicing software engineers participated in the survey. We raise a set of 12 research questions about the cross-factor correlation of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics, and address them using statistical analysis. Results The exploratory study results reveal important and interesting findings about cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics. Among some of the most interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and \\{SE\\} tasks; (2) Almost 55% of participants measure software size; (3) Agile/lean development is used the least (16%) by the participants working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4) Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small-sized companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme programming practices decreases. Conclusion The results of this exploratory study will be useful to software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and challenging experiences in using \\{SE\\} tools?, and (3) Why is Agile/lean development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how these approaches could be utilized more frequently.

While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. Objective We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. Method We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. Results The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. Conclusions The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering. Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of change.

Considering that instrumental approaches for project management are not sufficient for a flexible and uncertain product as software, the project success depends on how software project managers deal with the problems and make decisions. Different from the normative decision theory, which focus on how decisions should be made in order to be rational, the descriptive decision theory focus on how decisions are actually made and includes the naturalistic decision making models. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper aims to synthetize empirical studies published on journals and conferences proceedings that analyze the decision-making phenomenon in the software project management context from a naturalistic perspective. The search were conducted in five search engines: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, \\{IEEE\\} Xplore, and \\{ACM\\} Digital Library. The 27 selected papers were categorized and then synthesized into a thematic map. The categories included: agile development practices, stakeholders involvement, escalation and de-escalation of commitment factors, participatory decision-making, communication, use of rational methods, emotion, and cognitive biases. The results indicate that more studies are needed to better understand the decision-making phenomenon from this perspective.

For the benefit of academia and industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken. Objective This paper investigates two research questions: what challenges do agile practitioners face? and, how do practitioner challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify implications for research that is relevant to practice. Method A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to previous publications. Results Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under 27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation, sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which were inter-related. Over 50% of survey respondents experienced challenges highlighted in the case study. Conclusion The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such as governance and contracts, are under-researched, while others, such as business and \\{IT\\} transformation, have been researched but findings have not had the expected impact. Researchers wishing to address practitioner challenges need to treat them in context rather than in isolation and improve knowledge transfer.

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering for students' individual learning characteristics. To address this issue, learning styles become effective to understand students' different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the students' learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting students' learning style.

The first is identifying and helping business units and engineering teams adopt this method; the second is developing new management practices that are compatible with and can sustain the agile development practices. Although extant literature has conducted many analyses on these two challenges, there still exist gaps in the research of the agile development method. Herein, we explore how Cisco Systems addressed these two challenges followed by a discussion of the broad implications of adopting the agile development method. This research deepens our understanding of how to adopt and lead the agile development process.

The general expectation is that people and systems will interact in real-time. This poses pressure onto systems design to support increasing demands on computational power, while keeping a low power envelop. Additionally, modular scaling and easy programmability are also important to ensure these systems to become widespread. The whole set of expectations impose scientific and technological challenges that need to be properly addressed. The \\{AXIOM\\} project (Agile, eXtensible, fast I/O Module) will research new hardware/software architectures for cyber-physical systems to meet such expectations. The technical approach aims at solving fundamental problems to enable easy programmability of heterogeneous multi-core multi-board systems. \\{AXIOM\\} proposes the use of the task-based OmpSs programming model, leveraging low-level communication interfaces provided by the hardware. Modular scalability will be possible thanks to a fast interconnect embedded into each module. To this aim, an innovative \\{ARM\\} and FPGA-based board will be designed, with enhanced capabilities for interfacing with the physical world. Its effectiveness will be demonstrated with key scenarios such as Smart Video-Surveillance and Smart Living/Home (domotics).

It is very challenging for network operators to evolve their infrastructures to be more intelligent and agile in resource orchestration. Nowadays, the optical networks term denotes high-capacity telecommunications networks based on optical technologies and components that can provide capacity, provisioning, routing, grooming, or restoration at the wavelength level. The proposed Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) technology is expected to mitigate this problem by adaptively allocating spectral resources according to client traffic demands. In this paper, we focus on survivability problems in dynamic routing in EONs. We propose Adaptive Survivability (AS) approach to achieve the best trade-off between the efficiency of path protection and cost of routing. Moreover, we propose entirely new Routing, Spectrum and Modulation Assignment (RMSA) algorithm to optimize both anycast and unicast traffic flows.

A case study of three industrial cases was carried out to understand how to tailor agile methods effectively including also hardware development. Agile practices, mostly derived from Scrum, were tailored to fit the needs of each team and the method development was closely followed. Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were compared and complemented with interviews to understand the new working methods and their effects. Case evidence shows that interdependencies between work of each developer were taken into account better, visibility over the whole product increased and need for internal documentation diminished due to improved communication, but dividing hardware tasks into iterations was experienced difficult. With some tailoring, agile practices are beneficial also in the embedded system development. To successfully adopt agile methods into embedded system development, the team must consist of all the project members, the natural cycle lengths of different disciplines and different knowledge between the developers must be accepted and built upon, and the progress of the product must be presented or visualized in the end of each iteration.

The new paradigm greatly applies to military vehicles for the radical improvement of tactical and operational mobility. This article presents a new technological paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics that is studied as an extremely fast and exact response of the tire-soil couple to (i) the tire dynamic loading, (ii) transient changes of gripping and rolling resistance conditions on uniform stochastic terrains and (iii) rapid transient changes from one uniform terrain to a different uniform terrain. Tire longitudinal relaxation lengths are analyzed to characterize the longitudinal relaxation time constants. A set of agile characteristics is also considered to analyze agile tire slippage dynamics within a time interval that is close to the tire longitudinal relaxation time constants. The presented paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics lays out a foundation to radically enhance vehicle terrain mobility by controlling the tire slippage in its transient phases to prevent the immobilization of a vehicle. Control development basis and requirements for implementing an agile tire slippage control are also analyzed and considered.

One of the reasons for poor performance was assigned to project complexity. A combination of lean construction and agile project management are hypothesized as a possible solution to cope with project complexity. In this paper we aim to understand if the implicit usage of lean and agile help coping with complexity. The research was done by means of correlation analysis on data gathered from a structured questionnaire (67 responses). In total, 51 significant correlations among 255 possible relations were found. To reduce the number of variables, factor analysis was performed. Correlation analysis on the defined factors showed 8 significant correlations among 25 relations. Several lean and agile elements were shown to significantly correlate to either reducing complexity or managing complexity. It was therefore concluded that these are promising to cope with complexity and improve project performance, which is to be confirmed in subsequent research.

While adopting the most promising methods, a case study regarding the production technology for electrical energy storage systems was conducted. It showed that many agile aspects and tools are easily adoptable and help developers in the early stage depending on group size and complexity. They contribute by ensuring that complexity remains manageable, encouraging close teamwork, improving information circulation and supporting transparency.

In such highly diversified and open market environment, the integrated control strategy has expedited the concept of Demand Response. Currently, the important questions in the area of demand response are likely to shift from whether to adopt dynamic pricing to how to achieve fast demand response by the combination of technology and a competitive retail electricity market.

When traditional sequential development processes are employed the high degree of uncertainty connected to these innovations results in a long and costly development time, potentially leading to failure of the project. The paper at hand recommends highly iterative prototyping processes based on findings from the software industry where agile processes, mostly Scrum, are widely employed. In the development of physical products, prototyping is often unsystematic which is considered as a major obstacle to an efficient agile development process. This paper presents a systematic method of prototyping in the context of physical product development in order to gradually reduce the high degree of market and technological uncertainty associated with radical innovations. The prioritization of requirements is suggested to be the basis for the design of adequate prototypes. An analytical information-oriented approach is presented that continuously takes into account the amount of uncertainty in the dimensions market, product and process. The evaluation of the specific ratio of benefit and effort connected to the implementation of the requirements leads to their prioritization.

In this context, a comprehensive description (ontology) of involved components has a high significance. If certain technological aspects are missing during a production process, the production control should respond in a dynamic, versatile and adaptive (agile) manner to the overall value network. The possibility to describe the requirements of products for the necessary processes in the same namespace like the requirements of the necessary processes for the resources is a prerequisite to enable this behavior. Afterwards the different requirements will be placed in relation to the respective requirements. The aim is to define the necessary processes for the production based on the description of the product and the known resources in an agile way. Due to this a framework for a comprehensive description of automated production facilities, products and processes is described in this paper. The idea is that based on this framework a production facility can change the produced products without dedicated commissioning and ramp-up phases.

These dependencies delay delivery and as a result deteriorate the business value delivered in such value chains. The objective of our study is to support enterprises that suffer from such dependencies with a governance framework that helps them mitigate collaboration issues between sets of codependent Scrum teams. We first identify a set of intervention actions that aim to mitigate the collaboration issues between codependent Scrum teams. Second, we validate the effectiveness of these intervention actions in a large confirmatory industrial case study. This study was held in a large multi-national financial institute that worked with a large number of codependent Scrum teams. Third, we triangulate the findings in three focus groups. We finally package the intervention actions in a governance framework. The intervention actions led to a delivery time reduction from 29 days to 10 days. The participants in the focus groups confirmed the causality between the intervention actions and the observed delivery improvement. The empirical results show that the intervention actions, packaged in the governance framework, enable codependent sets of Scrum teams to deliver faster.

The goal was to develop a tool to improve infection prevention and control through local capacity building within the context of an emergency response. The research showed that digital technology could be a powerful 'force multiplier' allowing much greater access to high fidelity training during an outbreak and keeping it current as protocols evolved or new safety critical steps were identified. Tailoring training to the local context was crucial to its relevance and accessibility. This initiative used a novel approach to the development of the training tool - ebuddi. It used agile development to co-create the tool with active participation of local communities. A further pilot showed how it could be extended to meet the longer term needs of triage training and ensure better quality assurance. In the longer term it may have the potential to improve compliance with International Health Regulations, be adapted for future emergencies, and contribute to global health security.

The smart factory approach and the research and development pursuit of the fourth industrial revolution necessitate the refurbishment and upgrade of already existing manufacturing systems and the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in automation systems in order to achieve a holistic, company-wide information exchange and a pervasive traceability of product and manufacturing data. According to this approach, previous programmable logical controls (PLC), established business intelligence solutions and existing manufacturing execution systems (MES) with mutually lacking interfaces are integrated into a new ecosystem for planning, executing and analysis applications. Due to the fact that each system persists on its own user interface, the implementation has to be strongly coupled to a user centered design of innovative human machine interfaces, joined into one distributed, networked application. In this paper, an agile information processing framework for foundry purposes is presented. Every underlying application is accessible via web-based user interfaces providing control of each single system. This leads into a service orientated architecture triggering the individual underlying systems as services, which are connected using web communication technology to exchange data along a shared information model. The data storage is modular to ensure scalability and interoperability with other manufacturing departments. During the actual manufacturing process, different services like inline data mining analysis are deployed and the results are visualized in user demanded dashboards and reports. For new requirements in business intelligence and \\{MES\\} the developed interfaces are provided in a unique library and a content management system. The described architecture enhances the development of new information applications, accelerates the planning and execution process and is completely orientated to the demands of users, as fast planning procedures and analysis driven user interfaces.

Yet many organizations are unable to adapt effectively or quickly due to the established institutional arrangements and patterns of decision-making and governance. Adaptive governance should enhance the capacity of an organization to deal with and adapt to changes, while protecting the same organization from becoming unstable. Strategies of adaptive governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities, decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for governments. This means that adaptive governance implies a 'balancing act', and a reliance on ambidextrous strategies. The aim of this editorial is to introduce the concept of adaptive governance and discuss its implications for governments in the digital age.

Objective The main objective is to better understand the characteristics of successful software projects and contribute to software projects that are more likely to produce the planned client benefits. Method We asked 63 Norwegian software professionals, representing both the client and the provider role, to report information about their last completed project. In a follow-up survey with 64 Norwegian software professionals, we addressed selected findings from the first survey. Results The analysis of the project information showed the following: i) The project management triangle criteria of being on time, on budget, and having the specified functionality are poor correlates of the essential success dimension client benefits. ii) Benefit management planning before the project started and benefit management activities during project execution were connected with success in delivering client benefits. iii) Fixed-price projects and projects in which the selection of providers had a strong focus on low price were less successful in delivering project benefits than other projects. iv) Agile projects were in general more successful than other projects, but agile projects without flexible scope to reflect changed user needs and learning, or without frequent delivery to the client, had less than average success in delivering client benefits. Conclusions The software projects that were successful in delivering client benefits differed from the less successful ones in several ways. In particular, they applied benefit management practices during project execution, they avoided fixed-price contracts, they had less focus on low price in the selection of providers, and they applied the core agile practices - frequent delivery to the client and scope flexibility.

In particular, Scrum is an agile process framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11 companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns. The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum, and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where available, we have included company recommendations regarding the deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum concepts.

It provides an attractive alternative to more established development methods such as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). Given the growing demands for using agile methods for software development, we examine if systems analysts are more effective at modeling business systems by reusing business components than by reusing objects. We also examine whether the influence of component or object reuse on modeling performance is moderated by prior experience in systems analysis and design. We evaluate the representational constructs of the two based on a set of decomposition characteristics, and postulate hypotheses comparing the two based on theories in cognitive psychology and human factors. We find that models generated by reusing business components are of higher accuracy than those developed by reusing objects. An interesting finding of our study is that \\{IT\\} professionals who are less experienced in systems analysis and design perform on par with experienced professionals, when modeling business systems by reusing components. We argue that the decomposition characteristics of components--with respect to granularity, quality, and focus--enable less experienced analysts to perform on par with more experienced analysts.

For cognitive radio applications in particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent OFDM-based standards such as \\{IEEE\\} 802.11p for vehicular communication and \\{IEEE\\} 802.11af for \\{TV\\} whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a single basic channel without violating \\{SEM\\} specifications. The proposed method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict \\{RF\\} filter requirements, allowing the \\{RF\\} subsystem to be implemented using much less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions.

We argue that production lines are key enablers in organizational agility and any hostile and drifting behaviour could turn potential opportunities into losses besides the fact that an agile \\{EIS\\} is well integrated. There are many \\{ISs\\} developed to control and monitor the drifting behaviour of production lines like fault detection and classification (FDC), statistical process control (SPC) and automation systems. These offer excellent detection mechanisms against known drifts; however, real challenge lies in carrying out root-cause analysis for unknown drifts. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new category of \\{IS\\} for production lines as agile PLIS, capable to control, detect, assess and predict the potential drifts for proactive measures. The definition of an agile \\{IS\\} for production line is proposed with quality attributes selected from literature, \\{ISO\\} 91261 software quality standard and specificities of the production line. Further, generic measures of production line agility as local (LAI) and global (GAI) agility indices are proposed to measure the agility drifts for a production line.

The approach formulates the coupling as a control problem where the states are the solutions of the nonlocal and local equations, the objective is to minimize their mismatch on the overlap of the nonlocal and local domains, and the controls are virtual volume constraints and boundary conditions.

Every good user story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding the context of a user story. Objective We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making use of business process models. The method associates user stories with the corresponding business process model activity element. Method We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process model can be used to infer information about the execution order and integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of association granularity: a user story can be more abstract, approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of these three levels. Results Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of user stories when associated business process models are available. Conclusions We addressed a problem which arises from managing user stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing context of a user story. Our method contributes to the discipline of conceptual modeling in agile development. Our experiment provides empirical insight into requirement dependencies.

Particularly, electric cars represent this case and complexity is not only driven by product variants, but also by an increasing proportion and importance of software applications in value creation. However, the reference processes to develop these automotive products were established two decades ago. The reference process which is used by automotive \\{OEMs\\} is the integrated product and process development which bases on the concept of simultaneous engineering. In contrast to conventional cars with a combustion engine, product architectures for electric vehicles can be planned differently with the lithium-ion battery as the central and most expensive component and can be designed with more degrees of freedom. Such a product architecture can also be simplified that complexity is reduced for both, the product and the development process. Changes in terms of product architecture also imply that there are changes in the technological knowledge of the automotive OEM. It must focus on key technologies. Consequently, suppliers have got the chance to advance from suppliers, who produce products on demand, to technological experts, who provide technology platforms. The development process, moreover, has to evolve from typical stage-gate-concepts to a more agile process tailored to suit continuously changing requirements to fulfil the demand for a fast product qualification for series production. So, even shorter innovation cycles and time-to-market periods can be reached. Certainly, this has an effect on financial aspects with the objective to design the organisational process as lean as possible. Finally, the more agile process design serves an optimised ratio between engineering expenses and customer value - called Return on Engineering. It is the central paradigm to which process design and methods for product development need to adhere.

The introduction of procedural code sets for whole-exome and genome sequencing is a milestone toward financially sustainable clinical implementation; however, achieving reimbursement is currently a major challenge. As part of a prospective quality-improvement initiative to implement the new code sets, we adopted Agile, a development methodology originally devised in software development. We implemented eight functionally distinct modules (request review, cost estimation, preauthorization, accessioning, prebilling, testing, reporting, and reimbursement consultation) and obtained feedback via an anonymous survey. We managed 50 clinical requests (January to June 2015). The fraction of pursued-to-requested cases (n = 15/50; utilization management fraction, 0.3) aimed for a high rate of preauthorizations. In 13 of 15 patients the insurance plan required preauthorization, which we obtained in 70% and ultimately achieved reimbursement in 50%. Interoperability enabled assessment of 12 different combinations of modules that underline the importance of an adaptive workflow and policy tailoring to achieve higher yields of reimbursement. The survey confirmed a positive attitude toward self-organizing teams. We acknowledge the individuals and their interactions and termed the infrastructure: human pipeline. Nontechnical barriers currently are limiting the scope and availability of clinical genomic sequencing. The presented human pipeline is one approach toward long-term financial sustainability of clinical genomics.

The need for such features currently prevent the exploitation of reconfigurable robotics in manufacturing.

The work proposes a configuration algorithm that enables the identification of the robot architectures and the related reconfigurability features by selecting the type and number of robot modules to be implemented over time in order to better accomplish a number of production requirements. Particularly, assuming the robot will work by utilising a finite set of robotic modules, the algorithm determines the set of modules to form the arm and the ones to be allocated in the robot storage for possible usage over time. Results show a number of benefits such as a robotic chain with customised reaching and degrees of freedom with a reduced cost by performing an accurate module selection and configuration; this should lead the robot users to prefer reconfigurable robots to commercial rigid catalogue solutions proposed by robot manufacturers.

Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in flight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of flight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-specific responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and flight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p &lt; 0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and flight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efficiently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.

Companies are pushed to respond quickly and cost-efficient to changing markets. One way for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to become more agile, is to incorporate industrial robots in their production processes; larger enterprises already use this versatile piece of equipment for large batch sizes. To do so, a new perspective and approach is required, tailored to dynamic manufacturing systems in which production systems and components can be easily reconfigured, altered, swapped or replaced. A modular system architecture was developed within project \\{SInBot\\} upon which challenges in dynamic cooperation between robots and humans were projected. The developed system uses decentralized control and distributed intelligence, linked through an extensible, flexible, and fault-tolerant communication architecture. The rapidly growing complexity of traditional systems is compared to its decentralized counterpart to illustrate some of the many advantages of this new system architecture. A manufacturing scenario analogue is discussed and the approach to verify the performance of inner-system components, as well as the benefits of this approach. Key challenges that are encountered in implementing the cooperation into the current industrial environments are identified and projected upon the verification system.

Volatile and uncertain renewable energy sources cause high fluctuations in electricity prices and thus usually higher costs for the final user such as a melt shop. This paper presents an integrated production and electricity optimization system that can help the melt shop to adjust its production schedule to volatile electricity prices and thus lower its costs. An existing production scheduling optimization system based on a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming model has been further developed to account for electricity costs as well. It deploys an intelligent heuristics which decomposes the overall optimization problem into several sub-problems of smaller size in order to achieve faster and more robust solution. The electricity-aware optimization system has been successfully tested and implemented in a melt shop where it managed to reduce electricity costs by around 3%. At the same time, the system has improved coordination between different production stages, and thus made the entire melt shop more flexible, agile and responsive to unexpected events. The system has also been recognized as a very useful tool for running various simulations, what-if analysis and business scenarios on the melt shop in order to identify bottlenecks and further increase its production rate.

However, this activity may be misleading when a test suite is insufficiently robust for revealing faults. Particularly, refactoring faults can be tricky and difficult to detect. Coverage analysis is a standard practice to evaluate fault detection capability of test suites. However, there is usually a low correlation between coverage and fault detection. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on the use of coverage data of mostly impacted code elements to identify shortcomings in a test suite. We consider three real open source projects and their original test suites. The results show that a test suite not directly calling the refactored method and/or its callers increases the chance of missing the fault. Additional analysis of branch coverage on test cases shows that there are higher chances of detecting a refactoring fault when branch coverage is high. These results give evidence that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by refactoring edits. Furthermore, we propose a statistic model that evidences the correlation of coverage over certain code elements and the suite's capability of revealing refactoring faults.

A case study in seafood production is analysed from an end-to-end perspective in the flow of seafood from Norway to Japan to investigate how practitioners describe trading and the terminology used on trading embedded across the complete supply network. Four subcases that focus on how goods are traded are studied. Two subcases consider raw material supply, aquaculture-supplied salmon and wild-caught pelagic fish. The third subcase concerns the export of frozen mackerel to Japan, and the final subcase concerns seafood trading at a regional wholesale market in Japan. Analysis is based on the view that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are interdependent. The fundamental importance of sequential interdependencies in seafood production is demonstrated. The four subcases are first analysed individually, applying relational contracting theory to understand patterns of exchange leading to transfer of title at markets. Developed relationships and trust, but also an acceptance of partner switching, characterizes exchange in all four market-related subcases. An understanding of how these loosely coupled markets may be viewed as aligned is developed. Markets emerge as nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange facilitate agile seafood distribution.

Dynamic and agile clinical guidelines that reflect a rapidly changing knowledge base for decision-making support are needed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has been working on three initiatives to tackle these complex issues. The first initiative is ASCO's collaboration with other international organizations to create a framework to assess drugs for the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List, including nongenerics. The second initiative aims to define clinically meaningful outcomes as precision medicine expands the definition of cancers, leading to increased demand for the use of targeted drugs as single agents or in combination. The third initiative is ASCO's value framework, published in 2015, focusing on patient-physician shared decision making. The framework incorporates three parameters: 1) the meaningfulness of the clinical benefit, 2) the toxicity of the treatment, and 3) the patient's financial out-of-pocket cost. \\{ASCO\\} is concerned about the rising cost of cancer care when the clinical complexity and the pace of change in oncology are accelerating, and it is committed to help improve patient outcomes and value in cancer care as well as to engage the broader health care community in a process of collaborative improvement.

Agile practices emphasize frequent releases with the help of an automated toolchain from code to delivery. Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery, what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to customers. Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering delivery activities. Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used tools, such as \\{UI\\} testing and performance testing, were more distinctly missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current workflows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were able to deploy software more rapidly. Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals of the case organizations. Still, a well-founded toolchain supports speedy delivery of new software.

Although communication is key in the exchange of information between team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, \\{IT\\} infrastructure, etc.) and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic. Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD. The research question to which this study responds concerns how development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members, communication of the status of the development process, and communication of the status of the progress of the product under development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository tools, with information from the process development and product characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share information about the status of the project/process/product during the development process in order to overcome some of the still existing problems in communication in AGSD.

It relies on the analysis of an original, qualitative study of agile software development teams, which operate in an environment characterized by the simultaneous implementation of interdependent organizational routines. We argue that the interdependencies among routines are seized by organizational members who manipulate the level of 'protection' that each routine is granted (i.e. the enforcement of adherence to the routine). Less protection permits flexibility, whereas more protection creates stability. We observe that 'protection' can be exerted along two different, yet related, dimensions: content of the routine and performance of the routine. The interplay of these two dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility.

A positive effect of teamwork quality on team performance was found when team members and team leaders rated team performance. In contrast, a negligible effect was found when product owners rated team performance. The effect of teamwork quality on team members' learning and work satisfaction was strongly positive, but was only rated by the team members. Despite claims of the importance of teamwork in agile teams, this study did not find teamwork quality to be higher than in a similar survey on traditional teams. The effect of teamwork quality on team performance was only marginally greater for the agile teams than for the traditional teams.

Agile methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of teams on the same development programme. Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories used in the development process. Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews, supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in data analysis. Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance. It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to specific activities within each of the agile roles. Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding ceremonies.

Objective: To identify (a) the challenges to avoid risks to the collaboration by being aware of the challenges, (b) the best practices to provide an inventory of practices (patterns) allowing for an informed choice of practices to use when planning and conducting collaborative projects. Method: A systematic review has been conducted. Synthesis has been done using grounded-theory based coding procedures. Results: Through thematic analysis we identified 10 challenge themes and 17 best practice themes. A key outcome was the inventory of best practices, the most common ones recommended in different contexts were to hold regular workshops and seminars with industry, assure continuous learning from industry and academic sides, ensure management engagement, the need for a champion, basing research on real-world problems, showing explicit benefits to the industry partner, be agile during the collaboration, and the co-location of the researcher on the industry side.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software size measurement approaches more, or use different software development methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in small versus large companies? Objective Our objective is to get an understanding into the cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific demographic (e.g., small versus large companies). Thus, we decided to conduct an exploratory study in this area and collected real industrial data in the context of Turkey which has a vibrant software industry. Method To achieve the above objective, we use the data from a recent Turkish-wide survey of software engineering practices which was systematically designed with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian context and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). 202 practicing software engineers participated in the survey. We raise a set of 12 research questions about the cross-factor correlation of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics, and address them using statistical analysis. Results The exploratory study results reveal important and interesting findings about cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics. Among some of the most interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and \\{SE\\} tasks; (2) Almost 55% of participants measure software size; (3) Agile/lean development is used the least (16%) by the participants working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4) Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small-sized companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme programming practices decreases. Conclusion The results of this exploratory study will be useful to software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and challenging experiences in using \\{SE\\} tools?, and (3) Why is Agile/lean development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how these approaches could be utilized more frequently.

While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. Objective We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. Method We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. Results The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. Conclusions The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements.

Considering that instrumental approaches for project management are not sufficient for a flexible and uncertain product as software, the project success depends on how software project managers deal with the problems and make decisions. Different from the normative decision theory, which focus on how decisions should be made in order to be rational, the descriptive decision theory focus on how decisions are actually made and includes the naturalistic decision making models. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper aims to synthetize empirical studies published on journals and conferences proceedings that analyze the decision-making phenomenon in the software project management context from a naturalistic perspective. The search were conducted in five search engines: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, \\{IEEE\\} Xplore, and \\{ACM\\} Digital Library. The 27 selected papers were categorized and then synthesized into a thematic map. The categories included: agile development practices, stakeholders involvement, escalation and de-escalation of commitment factors, participatory decision-making, communication, use of rational methods, emotion, and cognitive biases. The results indicate that more studies are needed to better understand the decision-making phenomenon from this perspective.

For the benefit of academia and industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken. Objective This paper investigates two research questions: what challenges do agile practitioners face? and, how do practitioner challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify implications for research that is relevant to practice. Method A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to previous publications. Results Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under 27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation, sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which were inter-related. Over 50% of survey respondents experienced challenges highlighted in the case study. Conclusion The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while others, such as adoption, change focus over time.

Self-organizing agile teams are meant to share project management activities such as estimation, planning, and requirements elicitation with managers and customers. While prior literature has explored some individual management-related issues, little is known about how the high involvement of self-organizing agile teams influences everyday project management activities. Through a Grounded Theory study involving 21 agile practitioners across six software companies implementing scrum and XP, we identified a set of eight project management challenges as experienced by and as a result of self-organizing agile teams at multiple levels. These include delayed/changing requirements and eliciting senior management sponsorship at the project level; achieving cross-functionality and effective estimations at the team level; asserting autonomy and self-assignment at the individual level, and lack of acceptance criteria and dependencies at the task level. A mapping between the emergent challenges and standard project management activities is also presented. The article also shares practical implications and guidelines for agile teams, their managers, and customers for overcoming some of these challenges.

The suitability of an Agile approach to help organizations reach a certain \\{CMMI\\} maturity level in Web environments will be very interesting, as they will be able to keep the ability to quickly react and adapt to changes as long as their development processes get mature. Objective This paper responds to whether it is feasible or not, for an organization developing Web systems, to achieve a certain maturity level of the CMMI-DEV model using Agile methods. Method The proposal is analyzed by means of a systematic literature review of the relevant approaches in the field, defining a characterization schema in order to compare them to introduce the current state-of-the-art.

The present study aims to identify how daily stand-up meetings are conducted and what the attitudes towards them are. A grounded theory study with 12 software teams in three companies in Malaysia, Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom was conducted. We interviewed 60 people, observed 79 daily stand-up meetings and collected supplementary data. The factors that contributed the most to a positive attitude towards the daily stand-up meeting were information sharing with the team and the opportunity to discuss and solve problems. The factors that contributed the most to a negative attitude were status reporting to the manager and that the frequency of the meeting was perceived to be too high and the duration too long. Based on our results, we developed a grounded theory of daily stand-up meetings and proposed empirically based recommendations and guidelines on how to organize them. Organizations should be aware of the factors that may affect the attitude towards daily stand-up meetings and should consider our recommendations and guidelines to make this agile practice as valuable as possible.

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering for students' individual learning characteristics. To address this issue, learning styles become effective to understand students' different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the students' learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting students' learning style. Test results corroborate that students' outcomes improved when receiving the strategy that match their learning styles. Our data highlight opportunities for improving software engineering education by considering the students' learning preferences.

It is very challenging for network operators to evolve their infrastructures to be more intelligent and agile in resource orchestration. Nowadays, the optical networks term denotes high-capacity telecommunications networks based on optical technologies and components that can provide capacity, provisioning, routing, grooming, or restoration at the wavelength level. The proposed Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) technology is expected to mitigate this problem by adaptively allocating spectral resources according to client traffic demands. In this paper, we focus on survivability problems in dynamic routing in EONs. We propose Adaptive Survivability (AS) approach to achieve the best trade-off between the efficiency of path protection and cost of routing. Moreover, we propose entirely new Routing, Spectrum and Modulation Assignment (RMSA) algorithm to optimize both anycast and unicast traffic flows.

A case study of three industrial cases was carried out to understand how to tailor agile methods effectively including also hardware development. Agile practices, mostly derived from Scrum, were tailored to fit the needs of each team and the method development was closely followed. Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were compared and complemented with interviews to understand the new working methods and their effects. Case evidence shows that interdependencies between work of each developer were taken into account better, visibility over the whole product increased and need for internal documentation diminished due to improved communication, but dividing hardware tasks into iterations was experienced difficult. With some tailoring, agile practices are beneficial also in the embedded system development. To successfully adopt agile methods into embedded system development, the team must consist of all the project members, the natural cycle lengths of different disciplines and different knowledge between the developers must be accepted and built upon, and the progress of the product must be presented or visualized in the end of each iteration.

The new paradigm greatly applies to military vehicles for the radical improvement of tactical and operational mobility. This article presents a new technological paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics that is studied as an extremely fast and exact response of the tire-soil couple to (i) the tire dynamic loading, (ii) transient changes of gripping and rolling resistance conditions on uniform stochastic terrains and (iii) rapid transient changes from one uniform terrain to a different uniform terrain. Tire longitudinal relaxation lengths are analyzed to characterize the longitudinal relaxation time constants. A set of agile characteristics is also considered to analyze agile tire slippage dynamics within a time interval that is close to the tire longitudinal relaxation time constants. The presented paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics lays out a foundation to radically enhance vehicle terrain mobility by controlling the tire slippage in its transient phases to prevent the immobilization of a vehicle. Control development basis and requirements for implementing an agile tire slippage control are also analyzed and considered.

The results and the performances of the proposed algorithm have been determined and discussed considering the case of the Periodic Sun-Synchronous Orbits.

Increasing tough and competitive situations at demand-side have led the stakeholders of power system to reform, because people are more informed and can make decisions that has given rise to turbulent and volatile electricity markets. In such highly diversified and open market environment, the integrated control strategy has expedited the concept of Demand Response. Currently, the important questions in the area of demand response are likely to shift from whether to adopt dynamic pricing to how to achieve fast demand response by the combination of technology and a competitive retail electricity market. This paper assembles the part and parcel in the light of existing technologies for the development of the concept of agility in demand response, that can play a role as a service package which is designed to meet the customer satisfaction efficiently and reliably as well as improve the market responsiveness. For the first time, this paper encompasses the concept of Agile Demand Response that is defined as the ability of power system to survive and prosper in the competitive retail market by reacting to the market needs fast and effectively which are driven by the customers. This paper also presents the key enablers of the agile demand response, which are (1) Retail Market, (2) Virtual Supply-demand matching mechanism, (3) Integrated information system and (4) Stay Committed. The paper concludes that by bringing the enablers together - Agile \\{DR\\} improves the responsiveness to the retail market changes unambiguously.

When traditional sequential development processes are employed the high degree of uncertainty connected to these innovations results in a long and costly development time, potentially leading to failure of the project. The paper at hand recommends highly iterative prototyping processes based on findings from the software industry where agile processes, mostly Scrum, are widely employed. In the development of physical products, prototyping is often unsystematic which is considered as a major obstacle to an efficient agile development process. This paper presents a systematic method of prototyping in the context of physical product development in order to gradually reduce the high degree of market and technological uncertainty associated with radical innovations. The prioritization of requirements is suggested to be the basis for the design of adequate prototypes. An analytical information-oriented approach is presented that continuously takes into account the amount of uncertainty in the dimensions market, product and process. The evaluation of the specific ratio of benefit and effort connected to the implementation of the requirements leads to their prioritization.

In this context, a comprehensive description (ontology) of involved components has a high significance. If certain technological aspects are missing during a production process, the production control should respond in a dynamic, versatile and adaptive (agile) manner to the overall value network. The possibility to describe the requirements of products for the necessary processes in the same namespace like the requirements of the necessary processes for the resources is a prerequisite to enable this behavior. Afterwards the different requirements will be placed in relation to the respective requirements. The aim is to define the necessary processes for the production based on the description of the product and the known resources in an agile way. Due to this a framework for a comprehensive description of automated production facilities, products and processes is described in this paper. The idea is that based on this framework a production facility can change the produced products without dedicated commissioning and ramp-up phases.

These dependencies delay delivery and as a result deteriorate the business value delivered in such value chains. The objective of our study is to support enterprises that suffer from such dependencies with a governance framework that helps them mitigate collaboration issues between sets of codependent Scrum teams. We first identify a set of intervention actions that aim to mitigate the collaboration issues between codependent Scrum teams. Second, we validate the effectiveness of these intervention actions in a large confirmatory industrial case study. This study was held in a large multi-national financial institute that worked with a large number of codependent Scrum teams. Third, we triangulate the findings in three focus groups. We finally package the intervention actions in a governance framework. The intervention actions led to a delivery time reduction from 29 days to 10 days. The participants in the focus groups confirmed the causality between the intervention actions and the observed delivery improvement. The empirical results show that the intervention actions, packaged in the governance framework, enable codependent sets of Scrum teams to deliver faster.

The goal was to develop a tool to improve infection prevention and control through local capacity building within the context of an emergency response. The research showed that digital technology could be a powerful 'force multiplier' allowing much greater access to high fidelity training during an outbreak and keeping it current as protocols evolved or new safety critical steps were identified. Tailoring training to the local context was crucial to its relevance and accessibility. This initiative used a novel approach to the development of the training tool - ebuddi. It used agile development to co-create the tool with active participation of local communities. A further pilot showed how it could be extended to meet the longer term needs of triage training and ensure better quality assurance.

The smart factory approach and the research and development pursuit of the fourth industrial revolution necessitate the refurbishment and upgrade of already existing manufacturing systems and the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in automation systems in order to achieve a holistic, company-wide information exchange and a pervasive traceability of product and manufacturing data. According to this approach, previous programmable logical controls (PLC), established business intelligence solutions and existing manufacturing execution systems (MES) with mutually lacking interfaces are integrated into a new ecosystem for planning, executing and analysis applications. Due to the fact that each system persists on its own user interface, the implementation has to be strongly coupled to a user centered design of innovative human machine interfaces, joined into one distributed, networked application. In this paper, an agile information processing framework for foundry purposes is presented. Every underlying application is accessible via web-based user interfaces providing control of each single system. This leads into a service orientated architecture triggering the individual underlying systems as services, which are connected using web communication technology to exchange data along a shared information model. The data storage is modular to ensure scalability and interoperability with other manufacturing departments. During the actual manufacturing process, different services like inline data mining analysis are deployed and the results are visualized in user demanded dashboards and reports. For new requirements in business intelligence and \\{MES\\} the developed interfaces are provided in a unique library and a content management system. The described architecture enhances the development of new information applications, accelerates the planning and execution process and is completely orientated to the demands of users, as fast planning procedures and analysis driven user interfaces.

Yet many organizations are unable to adapt effectively or quickly due to the established institutional arrangements and patterns of decision-making and governance. Adaptive governance should enhance the capacity of an organization to deal with and adapt to changes, while protecting the same organization from becoming unstable. Strategies of adaptive governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities, decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for governments. This means that adaptive governance implies a 'balancing act', and a reliance on ambidextrous strategies.

Method We asked 63 Norwegian software professionals, representing both the client and the provider role, to report information about their last completed project. In a follow-up survey with 64 Norwegian software professionals, we addressed selected findings from the first survey. Results The analysis of the project information showed the following: i) The project management triangle criteria of being on time, on budget, and having the specified functionality are poor correlates of the essential success dimension client benefits. ii) Benefit management planning before the project started and benefit management activities during project execution were connected with success in delivering client benefits. iii) Fixed-price projects and projects in which the selection of providers had a strong focus on low price were less successful in delivering project benefits than other projects. iv) Agile projects were in general more successful than other projects, but agile projects without flexible scope to reflect changed user needs and learning, or without frequent delivery to the client, had less than average success in delivering client benefits. Conclusions The software projects that were successful in delivering client benefits differed from the less successful ones in several ways. In particular, they applied benefit management practices during project execution, they avoided fixed-price contracts, they had less focus on low price in the selection of providers, and they applied the core agile practices - frequent delivery to the client and scope flexibility.

In particular, Scrum is an agile process framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11 companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns. The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum, and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where available, we have included company recommendations regarding the deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum concepts.

It provides an attractive alternative to more established development methods such as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). Given the growing demands for using agile methods for software development, we examine if systems analysts are more effective at modeling business systems by reusing business components than by reusing objects. We also examine whether the influence of component or object reuse on modeling performance is moderated by prior experience in systems analysis and design. We evaluate the representational constructs of the two based on a set of decomposition characteristics, and postulate hypotheses comparing the two based on theories in cognitive psychology and human factors. We find that models generated by reusing business components are of higher accuracy than those developed by reusing objects. An interesting finding of our study is that \\{IT\\} professionals who are less experienced in systems analysis and design perform on par with experienced professionals, when modeling business systems by reusing components. We argue that the decomposition characteristics of components--with respect to granularity, quality, and focus--enable less experienced analysts to perform on par with more experienced analysts.

For cognitive radio applications in particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent OFDM-based standards such as \\{IEEE\\} 802.11p for vehicular communication and \\{IEEE\\} 802.11af for \\{TV\\} whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a single basic channel without violating \\{SEM\\} specifications. The proposed method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict \\{RF\\} filter requirements, allowing the \\{RF\\} subsystem to be implemented using much less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions.

We argue that production lines are key enablers in organizational agility and any hostile and drifting behaviour could turn potential opportunities into losses besides the fact that an agile \\{EIS\\} is well integrated. There are many \\{ISs\\} developed to control and monitor the drifting behaviour of production lines like fault detection and classification (FDC), statistical process control (SPC) and automation systems. These offer excellent detection mechanisms against known drifts; however, real challenge lies in carrying out root-cause analysis for unknown drifts. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new category of \\{IS\\} for production lines as agile PLIS, capable to control, detect, assess and predict the potential drifts for proactive measures. The definition of an agile \\{IS\\} for production line is proposed with quality attributes selected from literature, \\{ISO\\} 91261 software quality standard and specificities of the production line. Further, generic measures of production line agility as local (LAI) and global (GAI) agility indices are proposed to measure the agility drifts for a production line. The agility in an \\{IS\\} is built and not designed; therefore, we also present a compliance matrix of most widely used information system architectures (ISA) against proposed agile \\{PLIS\\} with quality attributes. This paper concludes by validating the proposed quantified measures of agility for agile \\{PLIS\\} using data from reputed semiconductor manufacturer.

Every good user story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding the context of a user story. Objective We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making use of business process models. The method associates user stories with the corresponding business process model activity element. Method We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process model can be used to infer information about the execution order and integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of association granularity: a user story can be more abstract, approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of these three levels. Results Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of user stories when associated business process models are available. Conclusions We addressed a problem which arises from managing user stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing context of a user story. Our method contributes to the discipline of conceptual modeling in agile development. Our experiment provides empirical insight into requirement dependencies.

Particularly, electric cars represent this case and complexity is not only driven by product variants, but also by an increasing proportion and importance of software applications in value creation. However, the reference processes to develop these automotive products were established two decades ago. The reference process which is used by automotive \\{OEMs\\} is the integrated product and process development which bases on the concept of simultaneous engineering. In contrast to conventional cars with a combustion engine, product architectures for electric vehicles can be planned differently with the lithium-ion battery as the central and most expensive component and can be designed with more degrees of freedom. Such a product architecture can also be simplified that complexity is reduced for both, the product and the development process. Changes in terms of product architecture also imply that there are changes in the technological knowledge of the automotive OEM. It must focus on key technologies. Consequently, suppliers have got the chance to advance from suppliers, who produce products on demand, to technological experts, who provide technology platforms. The development process, moreover, has to evolve from typical stage-gate-concepts to a more agile process tailored to suit continuously changing requirements to fulfil the demand for a fast product qualification for series production. So, even shorter innovation cycles and time-to-market periods can be reached. Certainly, this has an effect on financial aspects with the objective to design the organisational process as lean as possible. Finally, the more agile process design serves an optimised ratio between engineering expenses and customer value - called Return on Engineering. It is the central paradigm to which process design and methods for product development need to adhere.

The introduction of procedural code sets for whole-exome and genome sequencing is a milestone toward financially sustainable clinical implementation; however, achieving reimbursement is currently a major challenge. As part of a prospective quality-improvement initiative to implement the new code sets, we adopted Agile, a development methodology originally devised in software development. We implemented eight functionally distinct modules (request review, cost estimation, preauthorization, accessioning, prebilling, testing, reporting, and reimbursement consultation) and obtained feedback via an anonymous survey. We managed 50 clinical requests (January to June 2015). The fraction of pursued-to-requested cases (n = 15/50; utilization management fraction, 0.3) aimed for a high rate of preauthorizations. In 13 of 15 patients the insurance plan required preauthorization, which we obtained in 70% and ultimately achieved reimbursement in 50%. Interoperability enabled assessment of 12 different combinations of modules that underline the importance of an adaptive workflow and policy tailoring to achieve higher yields of reimbursement. The survey confirmed a positive attitude toward self-organizing teams. We acknowledge the individuals and their interactions and termed the infrastructure: human pipeline. Nontechnical barriers currently are limiting the scope and availability of clinical genomic sequencing. The presented human pipeline is one approach toward long-term financial sustainability of clinical genomics.

The usage of trifluoroacetic as fluorine precursor significantly modifies the morphology, size, pore shape, crystal phase, crystal structure, surface chemical state and to a lesser extent, {1 0 1} and {0 0 1} facets. The accessibility of fluoride ions on TiOTi polymer chains during crystal growth during the sol-gel process remarkably influences the properties of catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, preparation of F-doped TiO2 using modified sol-gel and trifluoroacetic acid are limited, and still not enough. Thus this work provides additional insight by using an approach which is less hazardous, less costly and practical for large scale agile development in the photocatalysis industry.

The Evaluation System follows a multi-perspective approach that involves internal and external stakeholders by applying a combination of evaluation instruments including key performance indicators, self-assessment- and audit procedures as well as monitoring- and reporting tools. As a main output of the Evaluation System, specific improvement suggestions and action plans can be derived to react agile on potential challenges.

The need for such features currently prevent the exploitation of reconfigurable robotics in manufacturing. The current work presents an approach to design and configure reconfigurable robots for the high precision manufacturing industry. The work proposes a configuration algorithm that enables the identification of the robot architectures and the related reconfigurability features by selecting the type and number of robot modules to be implemented over time in order to better accomplish a number of production requirements. Particularly, assuming the robot will work by utilising a finite set of robotic modules, the algorithm determines the set of modules to form the arm and the ones to be allocated in the robot storage for possible usage over time. Results show a number of benefits such as a robotic chain with customised reaching and degrees of freedom with a reduced cost by performing an accurate module selection and configuration; this should lead the robot users to prefer reconfigurable robots to commercial rigid catalogue solutions proposed by robot manufacturers.

Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in flight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of flight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-specific responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and flight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p &lt; 0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and flight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efficiently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.

One way for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to become more agile, is to incorporate industrial robots in their production processes; larger enterprises already use this versatile piece of equipment for large batch sizes. To do so, a new perspective and approach is required, tailored to dynamic manufacturing systems in which production systems and components can be easily reconfigured, altered, swapped or replaced. A modular system architecture was developed within project \\{SInBot\\} upon which challenges in dynamic cooperation between robots and humans were projected. The developed system uses decentralized control and distributed intelligence, linked through an extensible, flexible, and fault-tolerant communication architecture. The rapidly growing complexity of traditional systems is compared to its decentralized counterpart to illustrate some of the many advantages of this new system architecture. A manufacturing scenario analogue is discussed and the approach to verify the performance of inner-system components, as well as the benefits of this approach. Key challenges that are encountered in implementing the cooperation into the current industrial environments are identified and projected upon the verification system.

Volatile and uncertain renewable energy sources cause high fluctuations in electricity prices and thus usually higher costs for the final user such as a melt shop. This paper presents an integrated production and electricity optimization system that can help the melt shop to adjust its production schedule to volatile electricity prices and thus lower its costs. An existing production scheduling optimization system based on a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming model has been further developed to account for electricity costs as well. It deploys an intelligent heuristics which decomposes the overall optimization problem into several sub-problems of smaller size in order to achieve faster and more robust solution. The electricity-aware optimization system has been successfully tested and implemented in a melt shop where it managed to reduce electricity costs by around 3%. At the same time, the system has improved coordination between different production stages, and thus made the entire melt shop more flexible, agile and responsive to unexpected events. The system has also been recognized as a very useful tool for running various simulations, what-if analysis and business scenarios on the melt shop in order to identify bottlenecks and further increase its production rate.

However, this activity may be misleading when a test suite is insufficiently robust for revealing faults. Particularly, refactoring faults can be tricky and difficult to detect. Coverage analysis is a standard practice to evaluate fault detection capability of test suites. However, there is usually a low correlation between coverage and fault detection. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on the use of coverage data of mostly impacted code elements to identify shortcomings in a test suite. We consider three real open source projects and their original test suites. The results show that a test suite not directly calling the refactored method and/or its callers increases the chance of missing the fault. Additional analysis of branch coverage on test cases shows that there are higher chances of detecting a refactoring fault when branch coverage is high. These results give evidence that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by refactoring edits. Furthermore, we propose a statistic model that evidences the correlation of coverage over certain code elements and the suite's capability of revealing refactoring faults.

A case study in seafood production is analysed from an end-to-end perspective in the flow of seafood from Norway to Japan to investigate how practitioners describe trading and the terminology used on trading embedded across the complete supply network. Four subcases that focus on how goods are traded are studied. Two subcases consider raw material supply, aquaculture-supplied salmon and wild-caught pelagic fish. The third subcase concerns the export of frozen mackerel to Japan, and the final subcase concerns seafood trading at a regional wholesale market in Japan. Analysis is based on the view that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are interdependent. The fundamental importance of sequential interdependencies in seafood production is demonstrated. The four subcases are first analysed individually, applying relational contracting theory to understand patterns of exchange leading to transfer of title at markets. Developed relationships and trust, but also an acceptance of partner switching, characterizes exchange in all four market-related subcases. An understanding of how these loosely coupled markets may be viewed as aligned is developed. Markets emerge as nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange facilitate agile seafood distribution.

The importance of patient preferences and values increases in shared decision making especially when the cost of cancer care is continuing its steep rise. As our understanding of cancer systems biology increases, we are justifiably optimistic about therapeutic improvements but recognize that this has complicated the traditional Food and Drug Administration approval of drug indications based on organ-specific cancer for a particular drug. Dynamic and agile clinical guidelines that reflect a rapidly changing knowledge base for decision-making support are needed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has been working on three initiatives to tackle these complex issues. The first initiative is ASCO's collaboration with other international organizations to create a framework to assess drugs for the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List, including nongenerics. The second initiative aims to define clinically meaningful outcomes as precision medicine expands the definition of cancers, leading to increased demand for the use of targeted drugs as single agents or in combination. The third initiative is ASCO's value framework, published in 2015, focusing on patient-physician shared decision making. The framework incorporates three parameters: 1) the meaningfulness of the clinical benefit, 2) the toxicity of the treatment, and 3) the patient's financial out-of-pocket cost. \\{ASCO\\} is concerned about the rising cost of cancer care when the clinical complexity and the pace of change in oncology are accelerating, and it is committed to help improve patient outcomes and value in cancer care as well as to engage the broader health care community in a process of collaborative improvement.

This highly distributed computing environment can be used to provide ultra-low latency, precise positional awareness and agile applications, which could significantly improve user experience. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to consider next-generation paradigms such as Information-Centric Networking and Cloud Computing, integrated with the upcoming 5th Generation networking access. A cohesive end-to-end architecture is proposed, fully exploiting Information-Centric Networking together with the Mobile Follow-Me Cloud approach, for enhancing the migration of content-caches located at the edge of cloudified mobile networks. The chosen content-relocation algorithm attains content-availability improvements of up to 500% when a mobile user performs a request and compared against other existing solutions. The performed evaluation considers a realistic core-network, with functional and non-functional measurements, including the deployment of the entire system, computation and allocation/migration of resources. The achieved results reveal that the proposed architecture is beneficial not only from the users' perspective but also from the providers point-of-view, which may be able to optimize their resources and reach significant bandwidth savings.

Agile practices emphasize frequent releases with the help of an automated toolchain from code to delivery. Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery, what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to customers. Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering delivery activities. Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used tools, such as \\{UI\\} testing and performance testing, were more distinctly missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current workflows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were able to deploy software more rapidly. Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals of the case organizations. Still, a well-founded toolchain supports speedy delivery of new software.

Although communication is key in the exchange of information between team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, \\{IT\\} infrastructure, etc.) and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic. Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD. The research question to which this study responds concerns how development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members, communication of the status of the development process, and communication of the status of the progress of the product under development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository tools, with information from the process development and product characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share information about the status of the project/process/product during the development process in order to overcome some of the still existing problems in communication in AGSD.

It relies on the analysis of an original, qualitative study of agile software development teams, which operate in an environment characterized by the simultaneous implementation of interdependent organizational routines. We argue that the interdependencies among routines are seized by organizational members who manipulate the level of 'protection' that each routine is granted (i.e. the enforcement of adherence to the routine). Less protection permits flexibility, whereas more protection creates stability. We observe that 'protection' can be exerted along two different, yet related, dimensions: content of the routine and performance of the routine. The interplay of these two dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility.

Agile methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of teams on the same development programme. Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories used in the development process. Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews, supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in data analysis. Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance. It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to specific activities within each of the agile roles. Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding ceremonies.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software size measurement approaches more, or use different software development methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in small versus large companies? Objective Our objective is to get an understanding into the cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific demographic (e.g., small versus large companies).

Among some of the most interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and \\{SE\\} tasks; (2) Almost 55% of participants measure software size; (3) Agile/lean development is used the least (16%) by the participants working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4) Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small-sized companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme programming practices decreases. Conclusion The results of this exploratory study will be useful to software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and challenging experiences in using \\{SE\\} tools?, and (3) Why is Agile/lean development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how these approaches could be utilized more frequently.

In fact, antifragile software design is becoming a research issue in the software engineering community. We got inspired by the Agile Manifesto which set an important reference point to the software community, addressing primarily innovation in the software development process. We propose a similar approach to Antifragility, namely we would like to define the principles ruling the building up of software systems which exploit faults and errors to become better and stronger. This Manifesto does not want to be a fixed and complete set of principles. It is an open contribution to the discussion which needs to be improved and re-elaborated. All rights related to the Manifesto are free, open and belong to the community. This work represents our suggestions urging the community to start elaborating antifragile principles to lead their implementation in real organizations.

While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. Objective We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. Method We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. Results The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. Conclusions The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering. Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of change.

Considering that instrumental approaches for project management are not sufficient for a flexible and uncertain product as software, the project success depends on how software project managers deal with the problems and make decisions. Different from the normative decision theory, which focus on how decisions should be made in order to be rational, the descriptive decision theory focus on how decisions are actually made and includes the naturalistic decision making models. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper aims to synthetize empirical studies published on journals and conferences proceedings that analyze the decision-making phenomenon in the software project management context from a naturalistic perspective. The search were conducted in five search engines: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, \\{IEEE\\} Xplore, and \\{ACM\\} Digital Library. The 27 selected papers were categorized and then synthesized into a thematic map. The categories included: agile development practices, stakeholders involvement, escalation and de-escalation of commitment factors, participatory decision-making, communication, use of rational methods, emotion, and cognitive biases. The results indicate that more studies are needed to better understand the decision-making phenomenon from this perspective.

For the benefit of academia and industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken. Objective This paper investigates two research questions: what challenges do agile practitioners face? and, how do practitioner challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify implications for research that is relevant to practice. Method A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to previous publications. Results Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under 27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation, sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which were inter-related. Over 50% of survey respondents experienced challenges highlighted in the case study. Conclusion The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such as governance and contracts, are under-researched, while others, such as business and \\{IT\\} transformation, have been researched but findings have not had the expected impact. Researchers wishing to address practitioner challenges need to treat them in context rather than in isolation and improve knowledge transfer.

A grounded theory study with 12 software teams in three companies in Malaysia, Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom was conducted. We interviewed 60 people, observed 79 daily stand-up meetings and collected supplementary data. The factors that contributed the most to a positive attitude towards the daily stand-up meeting were information sharing with the team and the opportunity to discuss and solve problems. The factors that contributed the most to a negative attitude were status reporting to the manager and that the frequency of the meeting was perceived to be too high and the duration too long. Based on our results, we developed a grounded theory of daily stand-up meetings and proposed empirically based recommendations and guidelines on how to organize them.

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering for students' individual learning characteristics. To address this issue, learning styles become effective to understand students' different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the students' learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting students' learning style. Test results corroborate that students' outcomes improved when receiving the strategy that match their learning styles. Our data highlight opportunities for improving software engineering education by considering the students' learning preferences.

A case study of three industrial cases was carried out to understand how to tailor agile methods effectively including also hardware development. Agile practices, mostly derived from Scrum, were tailored to fit the needs of each team and the method development was closely followed. Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were compared and complemented with interviews to understand the new working methods and their effects. Case evidence shows that interdependencies between work of each developer were taken into account better, visibility over the whole product increased and need for internal documentation diminished due to improved communication, but dividing hardware tasks into iterations was experienced difficult. With some tailoring, agile practices are beneficial also in the embedded system development. To successfully adopt agile methods into embedded system development, the team must consist of all the project members, the natural cycle lengths of different disciplines and different knowledge between the developers must be accepted and built upon, and the progress of the product must be presented or visualized in the end of each iteration.

The new paradigm greatly applies to military vehicles for the radical improvement of tactical and operational mobility. This article presents a new technological paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics that is studied as an extremely fast and exact response of the tire-soil couple to (i) the tire dynamic loading, (ii) transient changes of gripping and rolling resistance conditions on uniform stochastic terrains and (iii) rapid transient changes from one uniform terrain to a different uniform terrain. Tire longitudinal relaxation lengths are analyzed to characterize the longitudinal relaxation time constants. A set of agile characteristics is also considered to analyze agile tire slippage dynamics within a time interval that is close to the tire longitudinal relaxation time constants. The presented paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics lays out a foundation to radically enhance vehicle terrain mobility by controlling the tire slippage in its transient phases to prevent the immobilization of a vehicle. Control development basis and requirements for implementing an agile tire slippage control are also analyzed and considered.

However, there is a need for empirical evidence on the impact, benefits and drawbacks of an agile transformation in an organization since the cost for such a transformation in terms of money, disrupted working routines and quality of development can become considerable. Currently, such evidence exists in the form of success stores and case studies, mostly of qualitative nature. Objective: Provide a metrics model to quantitatively measure the impact of an agile transformation in a software development organization. Method: The metrics model was elicited with the use of the Goal Question Metric approach. Results: A quantitative metrics model containing eight rigorously described metrics is presented and followed by its application to evaluate an agile and lean transformation in a large international telecommunication organization with 350 employees in two sites. Conclusions: The metrics model was sensitive to the changes that occurred in the organization and revealed significant improvements in six of the eight metrics and a deterioration in one of the metrics.

One of the reasons for poor performance was assigned to project complexity. A combination of lean construction and agile project management are hypothesized as a possible solution to cope with project complexity. In this paper we aim to understand if the implicit usage of lean and agile help coping with complexity. The research was done by means of correlation analysis on data gathered from a structured questionnaire (67 responses). In total, 51 significant correlations among 255 possible relations were found. To reduce the number of variables, factor analysis was performed. Correlation analysis on the defined factors showed 8 significant correlations among 25 relations. Several lean and agile elements were shown to significantly correlate to either reducing complexity or managing complexity. It was therefore concluded that these are promising to cope with complexity and improve project performance, which is to be confirmed in subsequent research.

To examine transferability of several agile methods to the predevelopment of hardware, the authors first theoretically analysed existing methods regarding their potential. While adopting the most promising methods, a case study regarding the production technology for electrical energy storage systems was conducted. It showed that many agile aspects and tools are easily adoptable and help developers in the early stage depending on group size and complexity. They contribute by ensuring that complexity remains manageable, encouraging close teamwork, improving information circulation and supporting transparency. Thus agile methods supplement concurrent predevelopment.

Increasing tough and competitive situations at demand-side have led the stakeholders of power system to reform, because people are more informed and can make decisions that has given rise to turbulent and volatile electricity markets. In such highly diversified and open market environment, the integrated control strategy has expedited the concept of Demand Response. Currently, the important questions in the area of demand response are likely to shift from whether to adopt dynamic pricing to how to achieve fast demand response by the combination of technology and a competitive retail electricity market. This paper assembles the part and parcel in the light of existing technologies for the development of the concept of agility in demand response, that can play a role as a service package which is designed to meet the customer satisfaction efficiently and reliably as well as improve the market responsiveness. For the first time, this paper encompasses the concept of Agile Demand Response that is defined as the ability of power system to survive and prosper in the competitive retail market by reacting to the market needs fast and effectively which are driven by the customers.

When traditional sequential development processes are employed the high degree of uncertainty connected to these innovations results in a long and costly development time, potentially leading to failure of the project. The paper at hand recommends highly iterative prototyping processes based on findings from the software industry where agile processes, mostly Scrum, are widely employed. In the development of physical products, prototyping is often unsystematic which is considered as a major obstacle to an efficient agile development process. This paper presents a systematic method of prototyping in the context of physical product development in order to gradually reduce the high degree of market and technological uncertainty associated with radical innovations. The prioritization of requirements is suggested to be the basis for the design of adequate prototypes. An analytical information-oriented approach is presented that continuously takes into account the amount of uncertainty in the dimensions market, product and process. The evaluation of the specific ratio of benefit and effort connected to the implementation of the requirements leads to their prioritization.

In this context, a comprehensive description (ontology) of involved components has a high significance. If certain technological aspects are missing during a production process, the production control should respond in a dynamic, versatile and adaptive (agile) manner to the overall value network. The possibility to describe the requirements of products for the necessary processes in the same namespace like the requirements of the necessary processes for the resources is a prerequisite to enable this behavior. Afterwards the different requirements will be placed in relation to the respective requirements. The aim is to define the necessary processes for the production based on the description of the product and the known resources in an agile way. Due to this a framework for a comprehensive description of automated production facilities, products and processes is described in this paper. The idea is that based on this framework a production facility can change the produced products without dedicated commissioning and ramp-up phases.

The smart factory approach and the research and development pursuit of the fourth industrial revolution necessitate the refurbishment and upgrade of already existing manufacturing systems and the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in automation systems in order to achieve a holistic, company-wide information exchange and a pervasive traceability of product and manufacturing data. According to this approach, previous programmable logical controls (PLC), established business intelligence solutions and existing manufacturing execution systems (MES) with mutually lacking interfaces are integrated into a new ecosystem for planning, executing and analysis applications. Due to the fact that each system persists on its own user interface, the implementation has to be strongly coupled to a user centered design of innovative human machine interfaces, joined into one distributed, networked application. In this paper, an agile information processing framework for foundry purposes is presented. Every underlying application is accessible via web-based user interfaces providing control of each single system. This leads into a service orientated architecture triggering the individual underlying systems as services, which are connected using web communication technology to exchange data along a shared information model. The data storage is modular to ensure scalability and interoperability with other manufacturing departments. During the actual manufacturing process, different services like inline data mining analysis are deployed and the results are visualized in user demanded dashboards and reports.

Yet many organizations are unable to adapt effectively or quickly due to the established institutional arrangements and patterns of decision-making and governance. Adaptive governance should enhance the capacity of an organization to deal with and adapt to changes, while protecting the same organization from becoming unstable. Strategies of adaptive governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities, decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for governments. This means that adaptive governance implies a 'balancing act', and a reliance on ambidextrous strategies. The aim of this editorial is to introduce the concept of adaptive governance and discuss its implications for governments in the digital age.

Method We asked 63 Norwegian software professionals, representing both the client and the provider role, to report information about their last completed project. In a follow-up survey with 64 Norwegian software professionals, we addressed selected findings from the first survey. Results The analysis of the project information showed the following: i) The project management triangle criteria of being on time, on budget, and having the specified functionality are poor correlates of the essential success dimension client benefits. ii) Benefit management planning before the project started and benefit management activities during project execution were connected with success in delivering client benefits. iii) Fixed-price projects and projects in which the selection of providers had a strong focus on low price were less successful in delivering project benefits than other projects. iv) Agile projects were in general more successful than other projects, but agile projects without flexible scope to reflect changed user needs and learning, or without frequent delivery to the client, had less than average success in delivering client benefits. Conclusions The software projects that were successful in delivering client benefits differed from the less successful ones in several ways. In particular, they applied benefit management practices during project execution, they avoided fixed-price contracts, they had less focus on low price in the selection of providers, and they applied the core agile practices - frequent delivery to the client and scope flexibility.

In particular, Scrum is an agile process framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11 companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns. The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum, and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where available, we have included company recommendations regarding the deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum concepts.

It provides an attractive alternative to more established development methods such as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). Given the growing demands for using agile methods for software development, we examine if systems analysts are more effective at modeling business systems by reusing business components than by reusing objects. We also examine whether the influence of component or object reuse on modeling performance is moderated by prior experience in systems analysis and design. We evaluate the representational constructs of the two based on a set of decomposition characteristics, and postulate hypotheses comparing the two based on theories in cognitive psychology and human factors. We find that models generated by reusing business components are of higher accuracy than those developed by reusing objects. An interesting finding of our study is that \\{IT\\} professionals who are less experienced in systems analysis and design perform on par with experienced professionals, when modeling business systems by reusing components. We argue that the decomposition characteristics of components--with respect to granularity, quality, and focus--enable less experienced analysts to perform on par with more experienced analysts.

For cognitive radio applications in particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent OFDM-based standards such as \\{IEEE\\} 802.11p for vehicular communication and \\{IEEE\\} 802.11af for \\{TV\\} whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a single basic channel without violating \\{SEM\\} specifications. The proposed method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict \\{RF\\} filter requirements, allowing the \\{RF\\} subsystem to be implemented using much less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions.

We argue that production lines are key enablers in organizational agility and any hostile and drifting behaviour could turn potential opportunities into losses besides the fact that an agile \\{EIS\\} is well integrated. There are many \\{ISs\\} developed to control and monitor the drifting behaviour of production lines like fault detection and classification (FDC), statistical process control (SPC) and automation systems. These offer excellent detection mechanisms against known drifts; however, real challenge lies in carrying out root-cause analysis for unknown drifts. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new category of \\{IS\\} for production lines as agile PLIS, capable to control, detect, assess and predict the potential drifts for proactive measures. The definition of an agile \\{IS\\} for production line is proposed with quality attributes selected from literature, \\{ISO\\} 91261 software quality standard and specificities of the production line. Further, generic measures of production line agility as local (LAI) and global (GAI) agility indices are proposed to measure the agility drifts for a production line. The agility in an \\{IS\\} is built and not designed; therefore, we also present a compliance matrix of most widely used information system architectures (ISA) against proposed agile \\{PLIS\\} with quality attributes. This paper concludes by validating the proposed quantified measures of agility for agile \\{PLIS\\} using data from reputed semiconductor manufacturer.

The approach formulates the coupling as a control problem where the states are the solutions of the nonlocal and local equations, the objective is to minimize their mismatch on the overlap of the nonlocal and local domains, and the controls are virtual volume constraints and boundary conditions. When some assumptions on the kernel functions hold, we prove that the resulting optimization problem is well-posed and discuss its implementation using Sandia's agile software components toolkit. The latter provides the groundwork for the development of engineering analysis tools, while numerical results for nonlocal diffusion in three-dimensions illustrate key properties of the optimization-based coupling method.

Every good user story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding the context of a user story. Objective We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making use of business process models. The method associates user stories with the corresponding business process model activity element. Method We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process model can be used to infer information about the execution order and integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of association granularity: a user story can be more abstract, approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of these three levels. Results Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of user stories when associated business process models are available. Conclusions We addressed a problem which arises from managing user stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing context of a user story. Our method contributes to the discipline of conceptual modeling in agile development. Our experiment provides empirical insight into requirement dependencies.

In contrast to related approaches, our methodology is capable of explicitly distinguishing between the individual, inherent agility of benign Internet services and criminal sites. Although some benign services use a large number of addresses, they are confined to a subset of \\{IP\\} addresses, due to operational requirements and contractual agreements with certain Content Distribution Networks. We discuss DNSMap, a system which analyzes observed \\{DNS\\} traffic, and continuously learns which \\{FQDNs\\} are hosted on which \\{IP\\} addresses. Any significant changes over time are mapped to bipartite graphs, which are then further pruned for cybercrime activity. Graph analysis enables the detection of transitive relations between \\{FQDNs\\} and IPs, and reveals clusters of malicious \\{FQDNs\\} and \\{IP\\} addresses hosting them. We developed a prototype system which is designed for realtime analysis, requires no costly classifier retraining, and no excessive whitelisting. We evaluate our system using large data sets from an \\{ISP\\} with several 100,000 customers, and demonstrate that even moderately agile criminal sites can be detected reliably and almost immediately.

Particularly, electric cars represent this case and complexity is not only driven by product variants, but also by an increasing proportion and importance of software applications in value creation. However, the reference processes to develop these automotive products were established two decades ago. The reference process which is used by automotive \\{OEMs\\} is the integrated product and process development which bases on the concept of simultaneous engineering. In contrast to conventional cars with a combustion engine, product architectures for electric vehicles can be planned differently with the lithium-ion battery as the central and most expensive component and can be designed with more degrees of freedom. Such a product architecture can also be simplified that complexity is reduced for both, the product and the development process. Changes in terms of product architecture also imply that there are changes in the technological knowledge of the automotive OEM. It must focus on key technologies. Consequently, suppliers have got the chance to advance from suppliers, who produce products on demand, to technological experts, who provide technology platforms. The development process, moreover, has to evolve from typical stage-gate-concepts to a more agile process tailored to suit continuously changing requirements to fulfil the demand for a fast product qualification for series production. So, even shorter innovation cycles and time-to-market periods can be reached. Certainly, this has an effect on financial aspects with the objective to design the organisational process as lean as possible. Finally, the more agile process design serves an optimised ratio between engineering expenses and customer value - called Return on Engineering. It is the central paradigm to which process design and methods for product development need to adhere.

The introduction of procedural code sets for whole-exome and genome sequencing is a milestone toward financially sustainable clinical implementation; however, achieving reimbursement is currently a major challenge. As part of a prospective quality-improvement initiative to implement the new code sets, we adopted Agile, a development methodology originally devised in software development. We implemented eight functionally distinct modules (request review, cost estimation, preauthorization, accessioning, prebilling, testing, reporting, and reimbursement consultation) and obtained feedback via an anonymous survey. We managed 50 clinical requests (January to June 2015). The fraction of pursued-to-requested cases (n = 15/50; utilization management fraction, 0.3) aimed for a high rate of preauthorizations. In 13 of 15 patients the insurance plan required preauthorization, which we obtained in 70% and ultimately achieved reimbursement in 50%. Interoperability enabled assessment of 12 different combinations of modules that underline the importance of an adaptive workflow and policy tailoring to achieve higher yields of reimbursement. The survey confirmed a positive attitude toward self-organizing teams. We acknowledge the individuals and their interactions and termed the infrastructure: human pipeline. Nontechnical barriers currently are limiting the scope and availability of clinical genomic sequencing. The presented human pipeline is one approach toward long-term financial sustainability of clinical genomics.

The need for such features currently prevent the exploitation of reconfigurable robotics in manufacturing. The current work presents an approach to design and configure reconfigurable robots for the high precision manufacturing industry. The work proposes a configuration algorithm that enables the identification of the robot architectures and the related reconfigurability features by selecting the type and number of robot modules to be implemented over time in order to better accomplish a number of production requirements. Particularly, assuming the robot will work by utilising a finite set of robotic modules, the algorithm determines the set of modules to form the arm and the ones to be allocated in the robot storage for possible usage over time. Results show a number of benefits such as a robotic chain with customised reaching and degrees of freedom with a reduced cost by performing an accurate module selection and configuration; this should lead the robot users to prefer reconfigurable robots to commercial rigid catalogue solutions proposed by robot manufacturers.

Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in flight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of flight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-specific responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and flight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p &lt; 0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and flight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efficiently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.

Companies are pushed to respond quickly and cost-efficient to changing markets. One way for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to become more agile, is to incorporate industrial robots in their production processes; larger enterprises already use this versatile piece of equipment for large batch sizes. To do so, a new perspective and approach is required, tailored to dynamic manufacturing systems in which production systems and components can be easily reconfigured, altered, swapped or replaced. A modular system architecture was developed within project \\{SInBot\\} upon which challenges in dynamic cooperation between robots and humans were projected. The developed system uses decentralized control and distributed intelligence, linked through an extensible, flexible, and fault-tolerant communication architecture. The rapidly growing complexity of traditional systems is compared to its decentralized counterpart to illustrate some of the many advantages of this new system architecture. A manufacturing scenario analogue is discussed and the approach to verify the performance of inner-system components, as well as the benefits of this approach. Key challenges that are encountered in implementing the cooperation into the current industrial environments are identified and projected upon the verification system.

Volatile and uncertain renewable energy sources cause high fluctuations in electricity prices and thus usually higher costs for the final user such as a melt shop. This paper presents an integrated production and electricity optimization system that can help the melt shop to adjust its production schedule to volatile electricity prices and thus lower its costs. An existing production scheduling optimization system based on a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming model has been further developed to account for electricity costs as well. It deploys an intelligent heuristics which decomposes the overall optimization problem into several sub-problems of smaller size in order to achieve faster and more robust solution. The electricity-aware optimization system has been successfully tested and implemented in a melt shop where it managed to reduce electricity costs by around 3%. At the same time, the system has improved coordination between different production stages, and thus made the entire melt shop more flexible, agile and responsive to unexpected events. The system has also been recognized as a very useful tool for running various simulations, what-if analysis and business scenarios on the melt shop in order to identify bottlenecks and further increase its production rate.

However, this activity may be misleading when a test suite is insufficiently robust for revealing faults. Particularly, refactoring faults can be tricky and difficult to detect. Coverage analysis is a standard practice to evaluate fault detection capability of test suites. However, there is usually a low correlation between coverage and fault detection. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on the use of coverage data of mostly impacted code elements to identify shortcomings in a test suite. We consider three real open source projects and their original test suites. The results show that a test suite not directly calling the refactored method and/or its callers increases the chance of missing the fault. Additional analysis of branch coverage on test cases shows that there are higher chances of detecting a refactoring fault when branch coverage is high. These results give evidence that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by refactoring edits. Furthermore, we propose a statistic model that evidences the correlation of coverage over certain code elements and the suite's capability of revealing refactoring faults.

A case study in seafood production is analysed from an end-to-end perspective in the flow of seafood from Norway to Japan to investigate how practitioners describe trading and the terminology used on trading embedded across the complete supply network. Four subcases that focus on how goods are traded are studied. Two subcases consider raw material supply, aquaculture-supplied salmon and wild-caught pelagic fish. The third subcase concerns the export of frozen mackerel to Japan, and the final subcase concerns seafood trading at a regional wholesale market in Japan. Analysis is based on the view that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are interdependent. The fundamental importance of sequential interdependencies in seafood production is demonstrated. The four subcases are first analysed individually, applying relational contracting theory to understand patterns of exchange leading to transfer of title at markets. Developed relationships and trust, but also an acceptance of partner switching, characterizes exchange in all four market-related subcases. An understanding of how these loosely coupled markets may be viewed as aligned is developed. Markets emerge as nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange facilitate agile seafood distribution.

The importance of patient preferences and values increases in shared decision making especially when the cost of cancer care is continuing its steep rise. As our understanding of cancer systems biology increases, we are justifiably optimistic about therapeutic improvements but recognize that this has complicated the traditional Food and Drug Administration approval of drug indications based on organ-specific cancer for a particular drug. Dynamic and agile clinical guidelines that reflect a rapidly changing knowledge base for decision-making support are needed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has been working on three initiatives to tackle these complex issues. The first initiative is ASCO's collaboration with other international organizations to create a framework to assess drugs for the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List, including nongenerics. The second initiative aims to define clinically meaningful outcomes as precision medicine expands the definition of cancers, leading to increased demand for the use of targeted drugs as single agents or in combination. The third initiative is ASCO's value framework, published in 2015, focusing on patient-physician shared decision making. The framework incorporates three parameters: 1) the meaningfulness of the clinical benefit, 2) the toxicity of the treatment, and 3) the patient's financial out-of-pocket cost. \\{ASCO\\} is concerned about the rising cost of cancer care when the clinical complexity and the pace of change in oncology are accelerating, and it is committed to help improve patient outcomes and value in cancer care as well as to engage the broader health care community in a process of collaborative improvement.

This highly distributed computing environment can be used to provide ultra-low latency, precise positional awareness and agile applications, which could significantly improve user experience. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to consider next-generation paradigms such as Information-Centric Networking and Cloud Computing, integrated with the upcoming 5th Generation networking access. A cohesive end-to-end architecture is proposed, fully exploiting Information-Centric Networking together with the Mobile Follow-Me Cloud approach, for enhancing the migration of content-caches located at the edge of cloudified mobile networks. The chosen content-relocation algorithm attains content-availability improvements of up to 500% when a mobile user performs a request and compared against other existing solutions. The performed evaluation considers a realistic core-network, with functional and non-functional measurements, including the deployment of the entire system, computation and allocation/migration of resources. The achieved results reveal that the proposed architecture is beneficial not only from the users' perspective but also from the providers point-of-view, which may be able to optimize their resources and reach significant bandwidth savings.

Agile practices emphasize frequent releases with the help of an automated toolchain from code to delivery. Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery, what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to customers. Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering delivery activities. Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used tools, such as \\{UI\\} testing and performance testing, were more distinctly missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current workflows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were able to deploy software more rapidly. Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals of the case organizations. Still, a well-founded toolchain supports speedy delivery of new software.

Although communication is key in the exchange of information between team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, \\{IT\\} infrastructure, etc.) and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic. Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD. The research question to which this study responds concerns how development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members, communication of the status of the development process, and communication of the status of the progress of the product under development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository tools, with information from the process development and product characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share information about the status of the project/process/product during the development process in order to overcome some of the still existing problems in communication in AGSD.

It relies on the analysis of an original, qualitative study of agile software development teams, which operate in an environment characterized by the simultaneous implementation of interdependent organizational routines. We argue that the interdependencies among routines are seized by organizational members who manipulate the level of 'protection' that each routine is granted (i.e. the enforcement of adherence to the routine). Less protection permits flexibility, whereas more protection creates stability. We observe that 'protection' can be exerted along two different, yet related, dimensions: content of the routine and performance of the routine. The interplay of these two dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility.

Agile methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of teams on the same development programme. Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories used in the development process. Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews, supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in data analysis. Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance. It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to specific activities within each of the agile roles. Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding ceremonies.

Objective: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize research about the most relevant approaches addressing the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were classified according to the phase of the development cycle they addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations. Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing issues related to different phases of the software development cycle for ubiquitous systems. Most approaches have been aimed at addressing the implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others phases such as testing need more attention from researchers. Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting case studies to make the studies more reproducible and closer to real life cases. While some phases of the development cycle have been extensively explored, there is still room for research in other phases, toward a more agile and integrated cycle, from requirements to testing and feedback.

The aim of this tertiary study is to consolidate empirical evidence regarding Agile and Lean practices and their respective impacts on project constraints as defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK): scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources, communication, and risk. In this tertiary study, 13 secondary studies were included for detailed analysis. Given the heterogeneity of the data, we were unable to perform a rigorous synthesis. Instead, we mapped the identified Agile and Lean practices, and their impacts on the project constraints described in PMBOK. From 13 secondary studies, we identified 13 Agile and Lean practices. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is studied in ten secondary studies, meanwhile other practices are studied in only one or two secondary studies. This tertiary study provides a consolidated view of the impacts of Agile and Lean practices. The result of this tertiary study indicates that \\{TDD\\} has a positive impact on external quality. However, due to insufficient data or contradictory results, we were unable to make inferences on other Agile and Lean practices.

The increasing prevalence of using these methods reflects their important role in the future of software development. However, leaving traditional approach and adapting to Agile approach has been a central attention of the researchers. Indeed, Agile transition needs enough time and effort and most often is subject to several challenges and barriers, mainly because of its people-centric nature. Human-related challenges in several studies have been reported as the major transition challenges. However, exploring the primary origins and reasons of these challenges has received less effort in a large-scale research study. A Grounded Theory in context of Agile software development has been conducted involving 49 Agile practitioners across the 13 different countries. This study identified different aspects of human-related challenges throughout Agile transition process. The results of this study show that the root of the emerged issues is the people's perceptions about Agile transition. The main purpose of this paper is to describe the origins and reasons of these challenges and issues in order to help software companies and development teams.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software size measurement approaches more, or use different software development methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in small versus large companies? Objective Our objective is to get an understanding into the cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific demographic (e.g., small versus large companies). Thus, we decided to conduct an exploratory study in this area and collected real industrial data in the context of Turkey which has a vibrant software industry. Method To achieve the above objective, we use the data from a recent Turkish-wide survey of software engineering practices which was systematically designed with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian context and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). 202 practicing software engineers participated in the survey. We raise a set of 12 research questions about the cross-factor correlation of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics, and address them using statistical analysis. Results The exploratory study results reveal important and interesting findings about cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics. Among some of the most interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and \\{SE\\} tasks; (2) Almost 55% of participants measure software size; (3) Agile/lean development is used the least (16%) by the participants working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4) Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small-sized companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme programming practices decreases. Conclusion The results of this exploratory study will be useful to software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and challenging experiences in using \\{SE\\} tools?, and (3) Why is Agile/lean development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how these approaches could be utilized more frequently.

While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. Objective We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. Method We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. Results The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. Conclusions The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering. Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of change.

Considering that instrumental approaches for project management are not sufficient for a flexible and uncertain product as software, the project success depends on how software project managers deal with the problems and make decisions. Different from the normative decision theory, which focus on how decisions should be made in order to be rational, the descriptive decision theory focus on how decisions are actually made and includes the naturalistic decision making models. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper aims to synthetize empirical studies published on journals and conferences proceedings that analyze the decision-making phenomenon in the software project management context from a naturalistic perspective. The search were conducted in five search engines: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, \\{IEEE\\} Xplore, and \\{ACM\\} Digital Library. The 27 selected papers were categorized and then synthesized into a thematic map. The categories included: agile development practices, stakeholders involvement, escalation and de-escalation of commitment factors, participatory decision-making, communication, use of rational methods, emotion, and cognitive biases. The results indicate that more studies are needed to better understand the decision-making phenomenon from this perspective.

For the benefit of academia and industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken. Objective This paper investigates two research questions: what challenges do agile practitioners face? and, how do practitioner challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify implications for research that is relevant to practice. Method A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to previous publications. Results Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under 27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation, sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which were inter-related. Over 50% of survey respondents experienced challenges highlighted in the case study. Conclusion The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such as governance and contracts, are under-researched, while others, such as business and \\{IT\\} transformation, have been researched but findings have not had the expected impact. Researchers wishing to address practitioner challenges need to treat them in context rather than in isolation and improve knowledge transfer.

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering for students' individual learning characteristics. To address this issue, learning styles become effective to understand students' different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the students' learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting students' learning style. Test results corroborate that students' outcomes improved when receiving the strategy that match their learning styles. Our data highlight opportunities for improving software engineering education by considering the students' learning preferences.

The general expectation is that people and systems will interact in real-time. This poses pressure onto systems design to support increasing demands on computational power, while keeping a low power envelop. Additionally, modular scaling and easy programmability are also important to ensure these systems to become widespread. The whole set of expectations impose scientific and technological challenges that need to be properly addressed. The \\{AXIOM\\} project (Agile, eXtensible, fast I/O Module) will research new hardware/software architectures for cyber-physical systems to meet such expectations. The technical approach aims at solving fundamental problems to enable easy programmability of heterogeneous multi-core multi-board systems. \\{AXIOM\\} proposes the use of the task-based OmpSs programming model, leveraging low-level communication interfaces provided by the hardware. Modular scalability will be possible thanks to a fast interconnect embedded into each module. To this aim, an innovative \\{ARM\\} and FPGA-based board will be designed, with enhanced capabilities for interfacing with the physical world. Its effectiveness will be demonstrated with key scenarios such as Smart Video-Surveillance and Smart Living/Home (domotics).

It is very challenging for network operators to evolve their infrastructures to be more intelligent and agile in resource orchestration. Nowadays, the optical networks term denotes high-capacity telecommunications networks based on optical technologies and components that can provide capacity, provisioning, routing, grooming, or restoration at the wavelength level. The proposed Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) technology is expected to mitigate this problem by adaptively allocating spectral resources according to client traffic demands. In this paper, we focus on survivability problems in dynamic routing in EONs. We propose Adaptive Survivability (AS) approach to achieve the best trade-off between the efficiency of path protection and cost of routing. Moreover, we propose entirely new Routing, Spectrum and Modulation Assignment (RMSA) algorithm to optimize both anycast and unicast traffic flows. Finally, we evaluate the performance of \\{RMSA\\} algorithms and assess the effectiveness of \\{AS\\} approach under various network scenarios. The main conclusion is that using \\{AS\\} approach results in significant improvement of network performance.

A case study of three industrial cases was carried out to understand how to tailor agile methods effectively including also hardware development. Agile practices, mostly derived from Scrum, were tailored to fit the needs of each team and the method development was closely followed. Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were compared and complemented with interviews to understand the new working methods and their effects. Case evidence shows that interdependencies between work of each developer were taken into account better, visibility over the whole product increased and need for internal documentation diminished due to improved communication, but dividing hardware tasks into iterations was experienced difficult. With some tailoring, agile practices are beneficial also in the embedded system development. To successfully adopt agile methods into embedded system development, the team must consist of all the project members, the natural cycle lengths of different disciplines and different knowledge between the developers must be accepted and built upon, and the progress of the product must be presented or visualized in the end of each iteration.

The new paradigm greatly applies to military vehicles for the radical improvement of tactical and operational mobility. This article presents a new technological paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics that is studied as an extremely fast and exact response of the tire-soil couple to (i) the tire dynamic loading, (ii) transient changes of gripping and rolling resistance conditions on uniform stochastic terrains and (iii) rapid transient changes from one uniform terrain to a different uniform terrain. Tire longitudinal relaxation lengths are analyzed to characterize the longitudinal relaxation time constants. A set of agile characteristics is also considered to analyze agile tire slippage dynamics within a time interval that is close to the tire longitudinal relaxation time constants. The presented paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics lays out a foundation to radically enhance vehicle terrain mobility by controlling the tire slippage in its transient phases to prevent the immobilization of a vehicle. Control development basis and requirements for implementing an agile tire slippage control are also analyzed and considered.

One of the reasons for poor performance was assigned to project complexity. A combination of lean construction and agile project management are hypothesized as a possible solution to cope with project complexity. In this paper we aim to understand if the implicit usage of lean and agile help coping with complexity. The research was done by means of correlation analysis on data gathered from a structured questionnaire (67 responses). In total, 51 significant correlations among 255 possible relations were found. To reduce the number of variables, factor analysis was performed. Correlation analysis on the defined factors showed 8 significant correlations among 25 relations. Several lean and agile elements were shown to significantly correlate to either reducing complexity or managing complexity. It was therefore concluded that these are promising to cope with complexity and improve project performance, which is to be confirmed in subsequent research.

While adopting the most promising methods, a case study regarding the production technology for electrical energy storage systems was conducted. It showed that many agile aspects and tools are easily adoptable and help developers in the early stage depending on group size and complexity. They contribute by ensuring that complexity remains manageable, encouraging close teamwork, improving information circulation and supporting transparency.

In such highly diversified and open market environment, the integrated control strategy has expedited the concept of Demand Response. Currently, the important questions in the area of demand response are likely to shift from whether to adopt dynamic pricing to how to achieve fast demand response by the combination of technology and a competitive retail electricity market.

When traditional sequential development processes are employed the high degree of uncertainty connected to these innovations results in a long and costly development time, potentially leading to failure of the project. The paper at hand recommends highly iterative prototyping processes based on findings from the software industry where agile processes, mostly Scrum, are widely employed. In the development of physical products, prototyping is often unsystematic which is considered as a major obstacle to an efficient agile development process. This paper presents a systematic method of prototyping in the context of physical product development in order to gradually reduce the high degree of market and technological uncertainty associated with radical innovations. The prioritization of requirements is suggested to be the basis for the design of adequate prototypes. An analytical information-oriented approach is presented that continuously takes into account the amount of uncertainty in the dimensions market, product and process. The evaluation of the specific ratio of benefit and effort connected to the implementation of the requirements leads to their prioritization.

The possibility to describe the requirements of products for the necessary processes in the same namespace like the requirements of the necessary processes for the resources is a prerequisite to enable this behavior. Afterwards the different requirements will be placed in relation to the respective requirements. The aim is to define the necessary processes for the production based on the description of the product and the known resources in an agile way. Due to this a framework for a comprehensive description of automated production facilities, products and processes is described in this paper. The idea is that based on this framework a production facility can change the produced products without dedicated commissioning and ramp-up phases.

These dependencies delay delivery and as a result deteriorate the business value delivered in such value chains. The objective of our study is to support enterprises that suffer from such dependencies with a governance framework that helps them mitigate collaboration issues between sets of codependent Scrum teams. We first identify a set of intervention actions that aim to mitigate the collaboration issues between codependent Scrum teams. Second, we validate the effectiveness of these intervention actions in a large confirmatory industrial case study. This study was held in a large multi-national financial institute that worked with a large number of codependent Scrum teams. Third, we triangulate the findings in three focus groups. We finally package the intervention actions in a governance framework. The intervention actions led to a delivery time reduction from 29 days to 10 days. The participants in the focus groups confirmed the causality between the intervention actions and the observed delivery improvement. The empirical results show that the intervention actions, packaged in the governance framework, enable codependent sets of Scrum teams to deliver faster.

The goal was to develop a tool to improve infection prevention and control through local capacity building within the context of an emergency response. The research showed that digital technology could be a powerful 'force multiplier' allowing much greater access to high fidelity training during an outbreak and keeping it current as protocols evolved or new safety critical steps were identified. Tailoring training to the local context was crucial to its relevance and accessibility. This initiative used a novel approach to the development of the training tool - ebuddi. It used agile development to co-create the tool with active participation of local communities. A further pilot showed how it could be extended to meet the longer term needs of triage training and ensure better quality assurance.

The smart factory approach and the research and development pursuit of the fourth industrial revolution necessitate the refurbishment and upgrade of already existing manufacturing systems and the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in automation systems in order to achieve a holistic, company-wide information exchange and a pervasive traceability of product and manufacturing data. According to this approach, previous programmable logical controls (PLC), established business intelligence solutions and existing manufacturing execution systems (MES) with mutually lacking interfaces are integrated into a new ecosystem for planning, executing and analysis applications. Due to the fact that each system persists on its own user interface, the implementation has to be strongly coupled to a user centered design of innovative human machine interfaces, joined into one distributed, networked application. In this paper, an agile information processing framework for foundry purposes is presented. Every underlying application is accessible via web-based user interfaces providing control of each single system. This leads into a service orientated architecture triggering the individual underlying systems as services, which are connected using web communication technology to exchange data along a shared information model. The data storage is modular to ensure scalability and interoperability with other manufacturing departments. During the actual manufacturing process, different services like inline data mining analysis are deployed and the results are visualized in user demanded dashboards and reports. For new requirements in business intelligence and \\{MES\\} the developed interfaces are provided in a unique library and a content management system. The described architecture enhances the development of new information applications, accelerates the planning and execution process and is completely orientated to the demands of users, as fast planning procedures and analysis driven user interfaces.

Yet many organizations are unable to adapt effectively or quickly due to the established institutional arrangements and patterns of decision-making and governance. Adaptive governance should enhance the capacity of an organization to deal with and adapt to changes, while protecting the same organization from becoming unstable. Strategies of adaptive governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities, decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for governments. This means that adaptive governance implies a 'balancing act', and a reliance on ambidextrous strategies.

Method We asked 63 Norwegian software professionals, representing both the client and the provider role, to report information about their last completed project. In a follow-up survey with 64 Norwegian software professionals, we addressed selected findings from the first survey. Results The analysis of the project information showed the following: i) The project management triangle criteria of being on time, on budget, and having the specified functionality are poor correlates of the essential success dimension client benefits. ii) Benefit management planning before the project started and benefit management activities during project execution were connected with success in delivering client benefits. iii) Fixed-price projects and projects in which the selection of providers had a strong focus on low price were less successful in delivering project benefits than other projects. iv) Agile projects were in general more successful than other projects, but agile projects without flexible scope to reflect changed user needs and learning, or without frequent delivery to the client, had less than average success in delivering client benefits. Conclusions The software projects that were successful in delivering client benefits differed from the less successful ones in several ways. In particular, they applied benefit management practices during project execution, they avoided fixed-price contracts, they had less focus on low price in the selection of providers, and they applied the core agile practices - frequent delivery to the client and scope flexibility.

In particular, Scrum is an agile process framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11 companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns. The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum, and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where available, we have included company recommendations regarding the deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum concepts.

It provides an attractive alternative to more established development methods such as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). Given the growing demands for using agile methods for software development, we examine if systems analysts are more effective at modeling business systems by reusing business components than by reusing objects. We also examine whether the influence of component or object reuse on modeling performance is moderated by prior experience in systems analysis and design. We evaluate the representational constructs of the two based on a set of decomposition characteristics, and postulate hypotheses comparing the two based on theories in cognitive psychology and human factors. We find that models generated by reusing business components are of higher accuracy than those developed by reusing objects. An interesting finding of our study is that \\{IT\\} professionals who are less experienced in systems analysis and design perform on par with experienced professionals, when modeling business systems by reusing components. We argue that the decomposition characteristics of components--with respect to granularity, quality, and focus--enable less experienced analysts to perform on par with more experienced analysts.

For cognitive radio applications in particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent OFDM-based standards such as \\{IEEE\\} 802.11p for vehicular communication and \\{IEEE\\} 802.11af for \\{TV\\} whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a single basic channel without violating \\{SEM\\} specifications. The proposed method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict \\{RF\\} filter requirements, allowing the \\{RF\\} subsystem to be implemented using much less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions.

There are many \\{ISs\\} developed to control and monitor the drifting behaviour of production lines like fault detection and classification (FDC), statistical process control (SPC) and automation systems. These offer excellent detection mechanisms against known drifts; however, real challenge lies in carrying out root-cause analysis for unknown drifts.

Method: In this study, a systematic literature review has been conducted considering articles published between 1999 and 2014. Results: In about 57% of the analyzed studies, the results were validated through experiments and in 32% of them, validation was performed through a case study. The results of this analysis show that 76% of the studies have identified a significant increase in internal software quality while 88% of the studies identified a meaningful increase in external software quality. There was an increase in productivity in the academic environment, while in the industrial scenario there was a decrease in productivity. Overall, about 44% of the studies indicated lower productivity when using \\{TDD\\} compared to TLD. Conclusion: According to our findings, \\{TDD\\} yields more benefits than \\{TLD\\} for internal and external software quality, but it results in lower developer productivity than TLD.

Every good user story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding the context of a user story. Objective We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making use of business process models. The method associates user stories with the corresponding business process model activity element. Method We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process model can be used to infer information about the execution order and integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of association granularity: a user story can be more abstract, approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of these three levels. Results Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of user stories when associated business process models are available. Conclusions We addressed a problem which arises from managing user stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing context of a user story. Our method contributes to the discipline of conceptual modeling in agile development. Our experiment provides empirical insight into requirement dependencies.

Particularly, electric cars represent this case and complexity is not only driven by product variants, but also by an increasing proportion and importance of software applications in value creation. However, the reference processes to develop these automotive products were established two decades ago. The reference process which is used by automotive \\{OEMs\\} is the integrated product and process development which bases on the concept of simultaneous engineering. In contrast to conventional cars with a combustion engine, product architectures for electric vehicles can be planned differently with the lithium-ion battery as the central and most expensive component and can be designed with more degrees of freedom. Such a product architecture can also be simplified that complexity is reduced for both, the product and the development process. Changes in terms of product architecture also imply that there are changes in the technological knowledge of the automotive OEM. It must focus on key technologies. Consequently, suppliers have got the chance to advance from suppliers, who produce products on demand, to technological experts, who provide technology platforms. The development process, moreover, has to evolve from typical stage-gate-concepts to a more agile process tailored to suit continuously changing requirements to fulfil the demand for a fast product qualification for series production. So, even shorter innovation cycles and time-to-market periods can be reached. Certainly, this has an effect on financial aspects with the objective to design the organisational process as lean as possible. Finally, the more agile process design serves an optimised ratio between engineering expenses and customer value - called Return on Engineering. It is the central paradigm to which process design and methods for product development need to adhere.

The introduction of procedural code sets for whole-exome and genome sequencing is a milestone toward financially sustainable clinical implementation; however, achieving reimbursement is currently a major challenge. As part of a prospective quality-improvement initiative to implement the new code sets, we adopted Agile, a development methodology originally devised in software development. We implemented eight functionally distinct modules (request review, cost estimation, preauthorization, accessioning, prebilling, testing, reporting, and reimbursement consultation) and obtained feedback via an anonymous survey. We managed 50 clinical requests (January to June 2015). The fraction of pursued-to-requested cases (n = 15/50; utilization management fraction, 0.3) aimed for a high rate of preauthorizations. In 13 of 15 patients the insurance plan required preauthorization, which we obtained in 70% and ultimately achieved reimbursement in 50%. Interoperability enabled assessment of 12 different combinations of modules that underline the importance of an adaptive workflow and policy tailoring to achieve higher yields of reimbursement. The survey confirmed a positive attitude toward self-organizing teams. We acknowledge the individuals and their interactions and termed the infrastructure: human pipeline. Nontechnical barriers currently are limiting the scope and availability of clinical genomic sequencing. The presented human pipeline is one approach toward long-term financial sustainability of clinical genomics.

The need for such features currently prevent the exploitation of reconfigurable robotics in manufacturing. The current work presents an approach to design and configure reconfigurable robots for the high precision manufacturing industry. The work proposes a configuration algorithm that enables the identification of the robot architectures and the related reconfigurability features by selecting the type and number of robot modules to be implemented over time in order to better accomplish a number of production requirements. Particularly, assuming the robot will work by utilising a finite set of robotic modules, the algorithm determines the set of modules to form the arm and the ones to be allocated in the robot storage for possible usage over time. Results show a number of benefits such as a robotic chain with customised reaching and degrees of freedom with a reduced cost by performing an accurate module selection and configuration; this should lead the robot users to prefer reconfigurable robots to commercial rigid catalogue solutions proposed by robot manufacturers.

Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in flight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of flight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-specific responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and flight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p &lt; 0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and flight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efficiently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.

Companies are pushed to respond quickly and cost-efficient to changing markets. One way for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to become more agile, is to incorporate industrial robots in their production processes; larger enterprises already use this versatile piece of equipment for large batch sizes. To do so, a new perspective and approach is required, tailored to dynamic manufacturing systems in which production systems and components can be easily reconfigured, altered, swapped or replaced. A modular system architecture was developed within project \\{SInBot\\} upon which challenges in dynamic cooperation between robots and humans were projected. The developed system uses decentralized control and distributed intelligence, linked through an extensible, flexible, and fault-tolerant communication architecture. The rapidly growing complexity of traditional systems is compared to its decentralized counterpart to illustrate some of the many advantages of this new system architecture. A manufacturing scenario analogue is discussed and the approach to verify the performance of inner-system components, as well as the benefits of this approach. Key challenges that are encountered in implementing the cooperation into the current industrial environments are identified and projected upon the verification system.

Volatile and uncertain renewable energy sources cause high fluctuations in electricity prices and thus usually higher costs for the final user such as a melt shop. This paper presents an integrated production and electricity optimization system that can help the melt shop to adjust its production schedule to volatile electricity prices and thus lower its costs. An existing production scheduling optimization system based on a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming model has been further developed to account for electricity costs as well. It deploys an intelligent heuristics which decomposes the overall optimization problem into several sub-problems of smaller size in order to achieve faster and more robust solution. The electricity-aware optimization system has been successfully tested and implemented in a melt shop where it managed to reduce electricity costs by around 3%. At the same time, the system has improved coordination between different production stages, and thus made the entire melt shop more flexible, agile and responsive to unexpected events. The system has also been recognized as a very useful tool for running various simulations, what-if analysis and business scenarios on the melt shop in order to identify bottlenecks and further increase its production rate.

However, this activity may be misleading when a test suite is insufficiently robust for revealing faults. Particularly, refactoring faults can be tricky and difficult to detect. Coverage analysis is a standard practice to evaluate fault detection capability of test suites. However, there is usually a low correlation between coverage and fault detection. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on the use of coverage data of mostly impacted code elements to identify shortcomings in a test suite. We consider three real open source projects and their original test suites. The results show that a test suite not directly calling the refactored method and/or its callers increases the chance of missing the fault. Additional analysis of branch coverage on test cases shows that there are higher chances of detecting a refactoring fault when branch coverage is high. These results give evidence that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by refactoring edits. Furthermore, we propose a statistic model that evidences the correlation of coverage over certain code elements and the suite's capability of revealing refactoring faults.

A case study in seafood production is analysed from an end-to-end perspective in the flow of seafood from Norway to Japan to investigate how practitioners describe trading and the terminology used on trading embedded across the complete supply network. Four subcases that focus on how goods are traded are studied. Two subcases consider raw material supply, aquaculture-supplied salmon and wild-caught pelagic fish. The third subcase concerns the export of frozen mackerel to Japan, and the final subcase concerns seafood trading at a regional wholesale market in Japan. Analysis is based on the view that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are interdependent. The fundamental importance of sequential interdependencies in seafood production is demonstrated. The four subcases are first analysed individually, applying relational contracting theory to understand patterns of exchange leading to transfer of title at markets. Developed relationships and trust, but also an acceptance of partner switching, characterizes exchange in all four market-related subcases. An understanding of how these loosely coupled markets may be viewed as aligned is developed. Markets emerge as nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange facilitate agile seafood distribution.

The importance of patient preferences and values increases in shared decision making especially when the cost of cancer care is continuing its steep rise. As our understanding of cancer systems biology increases, we are justifiably optimistic about therapeutic improvements but recognize that this has complicated the traditional Food and Drug Administration approval of drug indications based on organ-specific cancer for a particular drug. Dynamic and agile clinical guidelines that reflect a rapidly changing knowledge base for decision-making support are needed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has been working on three initiatives to tackle these complex issues. The first initiative is ASCO's collaboration with other international organizations to create a framework to assess drugs for the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List, including nongenerics. The second initiative aims to define clinically meaningful outcomes as precision medicine expands the definition of cancers, leading to increased demand for the use of targeted drugs as single agents or in combination. The third initiative is ASCO's value framework, published in 2015, focusing on patient-physician shared decision making. The framework incorporates three parameters: 1) the meaningfulness of the clinical benefit, 2) the toxicity of the treatment, and 3) the patient's financial out-of-pocket cost. \\{ASCO\\} is concerned about the rising cost of cancer care when the clinical complexity and the pace of change in oncology are accelerating, and it is committed to help improve patient outcomes and value in cancer care as well as to engage the broader health care community in a process of collaborative improvement.

Agile practices emphasize frequent releases with the help of an automated toolchain from code to delivery. Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery, what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to customers. Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering delivery activities. Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used tools, such as \\{UI\\} testing and performance testing, were more distinctly missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current workflows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were able to deploy software more rapidly. Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals of the case organizations. Still, a well-founded toolchain supports speedy delivery of new software.

Although communication is key in the exchange of information between team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, \\{IT\\} infrastructure, etc.) and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic. Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD. The research question to which this study responds concerns how development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members, communication of the status of the development process, and communication of the status of the progress of the product under development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository tools, with information from the process development and product characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share information about the status of the project/process/product during the development process in order to overcome some of the still existing problems in communication in AGSD.

Less protection permits flexibility, whereas more protection creates stability. We observe that 'protection' can be exerted along two different, yet related, dimensions: content of the routine and performance of the routine. The interplay of these two dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility.

This article investigates the effect of teamwork quality on team performance, learning and work satisfaction in agile software teams, and whether this effect differs from that of traditional software teams. A survey was administered to 477 respondents from 71 agile software teams in 26 companies and analyzed using structural equation modeling. A positive effect of teamwork quality on team performance was found when team members and team leaders rated team performance. In contrast, a negligible effect was found when product owners rated team performance. The effect of teamwork quality on team members' learning and work satisfaction was strongly positive, but was only rated by the team members. Despite claims of the importance of teamwork in agile teams, this study did not find teamwork quality to be higher than in a similar survey on traditional teams. The effect of teamwork quality on team performance was only marginally greater for the agile teams than for the traditional teams.

Agile methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of teams on the same development programme. Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories used in the development process. Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews, supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in data analysis. Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance. It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to specific activities within each of the agile roles. Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding ceremonies.

Results: Through thematic analysis we identified 10 challenge themes and 17 best practice themes. A key outcome was the inventory of best practices, the most common ones recommended in different contexts were to hold regular workshops and seminars with industry, assure continuous learning from industry and academic sides, ensure management engagement, the need for a champion, basing research on real-world problems, showing explicit benefits to the industry partner, be agile during the collaboration, and the co-location of the researcher on the industry side.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software size measurement approaches more, or use different software development methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in small versus large companies? Objective Our objective is to get an understanding into the cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific demographic (e.g., small versus large companies). Thus, we decided to conduct an exploratory study in this area and collected real industrial data in the context of Turkey which has a vibrant software industry. Method To achieve the above objective, we use the data from a recent Turkish-wide survey of software engineering practices which was systematically designed with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian context and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). 202 practicing software engineers participated in the survey. We raise a set of 12 research questions about the cross-factor correlation of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics, and address them using statistical analysis. Results The exploratory study results reveal important and interesting findings about cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices and practitioner demographics. Among some of the most interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and \\{SE\\} tasks; (2) Almost 55% of participants measure software size; (3) Agile/lean development is used the least (16%) by the participants working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4) Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small-sized companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme programming practices decreases. Conclusion The results of this exploratory study will be useful to software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and challenging experiences in using \\{SE\\} tools?, and (3) Why is Agile/lean development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how these approaches could be utilized more frequently.

While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. Objective We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. Method We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. Results The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. Conclusions The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements.

Considering that instrumental approaches for project management are not sufficient for a flexible and uncertain product as software, the project success depends on how software project managers deal with the problems and make decisions. Different from the normative decision theory, which focus on how decisions should be made in order to be rational, the descriptive decision theory focus on how decisions are actually made and includes the naturalistic decision making models. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper aims to synthetize empirical studies published on journals and conferences proceedings that analyze the decision-making phenomenon in the software project management context from a naturalistic perspective. The search were conducted in five search engines: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, \\{IEEE\\} Xplore, and \\{ACM\\} Digital Library. The 27 selected papers were categorized and then synthesized into a thematic map. The categories included: agile development practices, stakeholders involvement, escalation and de-escalation of commitment factors, participatory decision-making, communication, use of rational methods, emotion, and cognitive biases. The results indicate that more studies are needed to better understand the decision-making phenomenon from this perspective.

For the benefit of academia and industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken. Objective This paper investigates two research questions: what challenges do agile practitioners face? and, how do practitioner challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify implications for research that is relevant to practice. Method A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to previous publications. Results Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under 27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation, sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which were inter-related. Over 50% of survey respondents experienced challenges highlighted in the case study. Conclusion The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such as governance and contracts, are under-researched, while others, such as business and \\{IT\\} transformation, have been researched but findings have not had the expected impact. Researchers wishing to address practitioner challenges need to treat them in context rather than in isolation and improve knowledge transfer.

Besides, \\{CMMI\\} (Capability Maturity Model Integration) models are well-established approaches focused on assessing the maturity of an organization that develops software. Web Engineering is the field of Software Engineering responsible for analyzing and studying the specific characteristics of the Web. The suitability of an Agile approach to help organizations reach a certain \\{CMMI\\} maturity level in Web environments will be very interesting, as they will be able to keep the ability to quickly react and adapt to changes as long as their development processes get mature. Objective This paper responds to whether it is feasible or not, for an organization developing Web systems, to achieve a certain maturity level of the CMMI-DEV model using Agile methods. Method The proposal is analyzed by means of a systematic literature review of the relevant approaches in the field, defining a characterization schema in order to compare them to introduce the current state-of-the-art. Results The results achieved after the systematic literature review are presented, analyzed and compared against the defined schema, extracting relevant conclusions for the different dimensions of the problem: compatibility, compliance, experience, maturity and Web. Conclusion It is concluded that although the definition of an Agile approach to meet the different \\{CMMI\\} maturity levels goals could be possible for an organization developing Web systems, there is still a lack of detailed studies and analysis on the field.

The present study aims to identify how daily stand-up meetings are conducted and what the attitudes towards them are. A grounded theory study with 12 software teams in three companies in Malaysia, Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom was conducted. We interviewed 60 people, observed 79 daily stand-up meetings and collected supplementary data. The factors that contributed the most to a positive attitude towards the daily stand-up meeting were information sharing with the team and the opportunity to discuss and solve problems. The factors that contributed the most to a negative attitude were status reporting to the manager and that the frequency of the meeting was perceived to be too high and the duration too long. Based on our results, we developed a grounded theory of daily stand-up meetings and proposed empirically based recommendations and guidelines on how to organize them. Organizations should be aware of the factors that may affect the attitude towards daily stand-up meetings and should consider our recommendations and guidelines to make this agile practice as valuable as possible.

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering for students' individual learning characteristics. To address this issue, learning styles become effective to understand students' different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the students' learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting students' learning style. Test results corroborate that students' outcomes improved when receiving the strategy that match their learning styles. Our data highlight opportunities for improving software engineering education by considering the students' learning preferences.

The proposed Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) technology is expected to mitigate this problem by adaptively allocating spectral resources according to client traffic demands. In this paper, we focus on survivability problems in dynamic routing in EONs. We propose Adaptive Survivability (AS) approach to achieve the best trade-off between the efficiency of path protection and cost of routing.

A case study of three industrial cases was carried out to understand how to tailor agile methods effectively including also hardware development. Agile practices, mostly derived from Scrum, were tailored to fit the needs of each team and the method development was closely followed. Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were compared and complemented with interviews to understand the new working methods and their effects. Case evidence shows that interdependencies between work of each developer were taken into account better, visibility over the whole product increased and need for internal documentation diminished due to improved communication, but dividing hardware tasks into iterations was experienced difficult. With some tailoring, agile practices are beneficial also in the embedded system development. To successfully adopt agile methods into embedded system development, the team must consist of all the project members, the natural cycle lengths of different disciplines and different knowledge between the developers must be accepted and built upon, and the progress of the product must be presented or visualized in the end of each iteration.

The new paradigm greatly applies to military vehicles for the radical improvement of tactical and operational mobility. This article presents a new technological paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics that is studied as an extremely fast and exact response of the tire-soil couple to (i) the tire dynamic loading, (ii) transient changes of gripping and rolling resistance conditions on uniform stochastic terrains and (iii) rapid transient changes from one uniform terrain to a different uniform terrain. Tire longitudinal relaxation lengths are analyzed to characterize the longitudinal relaxation time constants. A set of agile characteristics is also considered to analyze agile tire slippage dynamics within a time interval that is close to the tire longitudinal relaxation time constants. The presented paradigm of agile tire slippage dynamics lays out a foundation to radically enhance vehicle terrain mobility by controlling the tire slippage in its transient phases to prevent the immobilization of a vehicle. Control development basis and requirements for implementing an agile tire slippage control are also analyzed and considered.

Fundamentally, this algorithm can be subdivided into two parts: in the first one the algorithm operates a geometric classification of the areas of interest and a partitioning of these areas into stripes which develop along the optimal scan directions; in the second one it computes the succession of the time windows in which the acquisition operations of the areas of interest are feasible, taking into consideration the potential restrictions associated with these operations and with the geometric and stereoscopic constraints. The results and the performances of the proposed algorithm have been determined and discussed considering the case of the Periodic Sun-Synchronous Orbits.

Increasing tough and competitive situations at demand-side have led the stakeholders of power system to reform, because people are more informed and can make decisions that has given rise to turbulent and volatile electricity markets. In such highly diversified and open market environment, the integrated control strategy has expedited the concept of Demand Response. Currently, the important questions in the area of demand response are likely to shift from whether to adopt dynamic pricing to how to achieve fast demand response by the combination of technology and a competitive retail electricity market. This paper assembles the part and parcel in the light of existing technologies for the development of the concept of agility in demand response, that can play a role as a service package which is designed to meet the customer satisfaction efficiently and reliably as well as improve the market responsiveness. For the first time, this paper encompasses the concept of Agile Demand Response that is defined as the ability of power system to survive and prosper in the competitive retail market by reacting to the market needs fast and effectively which are driven by the customers. This paper also presents the key enablers of the agile demand response, which are (1) Retail Market, (2) Virtual Supply-demand matching mechanism, (3) Integrated information system and (4) Stay Committed. The paper concludes that by bringing the enablers together - Agile \\{DR\\} improves the responsiveness to the retail market changes unambiguously.

When traditional sequential development processes are employed the high degree of uncertainty connected to these innovations results in a long and costly development time, potentially leading to failure of the project. The paper at hand recommends highly iterative prototyping processes based on findings from the software industry where agile processes, mostly Scrum, are widely employed. In the development of physical products, prototyping is often unsystematic which is considered as a major obstacle to an efficient agile development process. This paper presents a systematic method of prototyping in the context of physical product development in order to gradually reduce the high degree of market and technological uncertainty associated with radical innovations. The prioritization of requirements is suggested to be the basis for the design of adequate prototypes. An analytical information-oriented approach is presented that continuously takes into account the amount of uncertainty in the dimensions market, product and process. The evaluation of the specific ratio of benefit and effort connected to the implementation of the requirements leads to their prioritization.

In this context, a comprehensive description (ontology) of involved components has a high significance. If certain technological aspects are missing during a production process, the production control should respond in a dynamic, versatile and adaptive (agile) manner to the overall value network. The possibility to describe the requirements of products for the necessary processes in the same namespace like the requirements of the necessary processes for the resources is a prerequisite to enable this behavior. Afterwards the different requirements will be placed in relation to the respective requirements. The aim is to define the necessary processes for the production based on the description of the product and the known resources in an agile way.

The objective of our study is to support enterprises that suffer from such dependencies with a governance framework that helps them mitigate collaboration issues between sets of codependent Scrum teams. We first identify a set of intervention actions that aim to mitigate the collaboration issues between codependent Scrum teams. Second, we validate the effectiveness of these intervention actions in a large confirmatory industrial case study. This study was held in a large multi-national financial institute that worked with a large number of codependent Scrum teams. Third, we triangulate the findings in three focus groups. We finally package the intervention actions in a governance framework. The intervention actions led to a delivery time reduction from 29 days to 10 days. The participants in the focus groups confirmed the causality between the intervention actions and the observed delivery improvement. The empirical results show that the intervention actions, packaged in the governance framework, enable codependent sets of Scrum teams to deliver faster.

The research showed that digital technology could be a powerful 'force multiplier' allowing much greater access to high fidelity training during an outbreak and keeping it current as protocols evolved or new safety critical steps were identified. Tailoring training to the local context was crucial to its relevance and accessibility. This initiative used a novel approach to the development of the training tool - ebuddi. It used agile development to co-create the tool with active participation of local communities. A further pilot showed how it could be extended to meet the longer term needs of triage training and ensure better quality assurance.

The smart factory approach and the research and development pursuit of the fourth industrial revolution necessitate the refurbishment and upgrade of already existing manufacturing systems and the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in automation systems in order to achieve a holistic, company-wide information exchange and a pervasive traceability of product and manufacturing data. According to this approach, previous programmable logical controls (PLC), established business intelligence solutions and existing manufacturing execution systems (MES) with mutually lacking interfaces are integrated into a new ecosystem for planning, executing and analysis applications. Due to the fact that each system persists on its own user interface, the implementation has to be strongly coupled to a user centered design of innovative human machine interfaces, joined into one distributed, networked application. In this paper, an agile information processing framework for foundry purposes is presented. Every underlying application is accessible via web-based user interfaces providing control of each single system. This leads into a service orientated architecture triggering the individual underlying systems as services, which are connected using web communication technology to exchange data along a shared information model. The data storage is modular to ensure scalability and interoperability with other manufacturing departments. During the actual manufacturing process, different services like inline data mining analysis are deployed and the results are visualized in user demanded dashboards and reports. For new requirements in business intelligence and \\{MES\\} the developed interfaces are provided in a unique library and a content management system. The described architecture enhances the development of new information applications, accelerates the planning and execution process and is completely orientated to the demands of users, as fast planning procedures and analysis driven user interfaces.

Yet many organizations are unable to adapt effectively or quickly due to the established institutional arrangements and patterns of decision-making and governance. Adaptive governance should enhance the capacity of an organization to deal with and adapt to changes, while protecting the same organization from becoming unstable. Strategies of adaptive governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities, decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for governments. This means that adaptive governance implies a 'balancing act', and a reliance on ambidextrous strategies.

Method We asked 63 Norwegian software professionals, representing both the client and the provider role, to report information about their last completed project. In a follow-up survey with 64 Norwegian software professionals, we addressed selected findings from the first survey. Results The analysis of the project information showed the following: i) The project management triangle criteria of being on time, on budget, and having the specified functionality are poor correlates of the essential success dimension client benefits. ii) Benefit management planning before the project started and benefit management activities during project execution were connected with success in delivering client benefits. iii) Fixed-price projects and projects in which the selection of providers had a strong focus on low price were less successful in delivering project benefits than other projects. iv) Agile projects were in general more successful than other projects, but agile projects without flexible scope to reflect changed user needs and learning, or without frequent delivery to the client, had less than average success in delivering client benefits. Conclusions The software projects that were successful in delivering client benefits differed from the less successful ones in several ways. In particular, they applied benefit management practices during project execution, they avoided fixed-price contracts, they had less focus on low price in the selection of providers, and they applied the core agile practices - frequent delivery to the client and scope flexibility.

In particular, Scrum is an agile process framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11 companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns. The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum, and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where available, we have included company recommendations regarding the deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum concepts.

It provides an attractive alternative to more established development methods such as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). Given the growing demands for using agile methods for software development, we examine if systems analysts are more effective at modeling business systems by reusing business components than by reusing objects. We also examine whether the influence of component or object reuse on modeling performance is moderated by prior experience in systems analysis and design. We evaluate the representational constructs of the two based on a set of decomposition characteristics, and postulate hypotheses comparing the two based on theories in cognitive psychology and human factors. We find that models generated by reusing business components are of higher accuracy than those developed by reusing objects. An interesting finding of our study is that \\{IT\\} professionals who are less experienced in systems analysis and design perform on par with experienced professionals, when modeling business systems by reusing components. We argue that the decomposition characteristics of components--with respect to granularity, quality, and focus--enable less experienced analysts to perform on par with more experienced analysts.

For cognitive radio applications in particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent OFDM-based standards such as \\{IEEE\\} 802.11p for vehicular communication and \\{IEEE\\} 802.11af for \\{TV\\} whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a single basic channel without violating \\{SEM\\} specifications. The proposed method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict \\{RF\\} filter requirements, allowing the \\{RF\\} subsystem to be implemented using much less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions.

Experts appreciate improvements in interdisciplinary collaboration, lead times and development costs by applying agile techniques as artifacts, meetings, roles and visualisation methods. Up to now, the use of agile procedures is still limited to IT-projects, due to a lack of profound knowledge in transferring agile techniques into interdisciplinary projects. This contribution presents the research work on Agile Engineering, a counterpart of Lean Product Development, by the systematic integration of agile techniques into the development process of mechatronic production systems. Thereto, an introduction and state of the art is given concerning the industry sector of machinery and plant construction as well as agile methodologies. The main focus of the paper is represented by the classification and comparison of Agile Engineering as well as the main features of integrating agile techniques into the mechatronic engineering process. According to the advanced research insights of the last years, Agile Engineering is a new enabler of success for establishing an agile production, providing promising approaches for coping with change and uncertainty efficiently.

We argue that production lines are key enablers in organizational agility and any hostile and drifting behaviour could turn potential opportunities into losses besides the fact that an agile \\{EIS\\} is well integrated. There are many \\{ISs\\} developed to control and monitor the drifting behaviour of production lines like fault detection and classification (FDC), statistical process control (SPC) and automation systems. These offer excellent detection mechanisms against known drifts; however, real challenge lies in carrying out root-cause analysis for unknown drifts. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new category of \\{IS\\} for production lines as agile PLIS, capable to control, detect, assess and predict the potential drifts for proactive measures. The definition of an agile \\{IS\\} for production line is proposed with quality attributes selected from literature, \\{ISO\\} 91261 software quality standard and specificities of the production line. Further, generic measures of production line agility as local (LAI) and global (GAI) agility indices are proposed to measure the agility drifts for a production line. The agility in an \\{IS\\} is built and not designed; therefore, we also present a compliance matrix of most widely used information system architectures (ISA) against proposed agile \\{PLIS\\} with quality attributes. This paper concludes by validating the proposed quantified measures of agility for agile \\{PLIS\\} using data from reputed semiconductor manufacturer.

Every good user story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding the context of a user story. Objective We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making use of business process models. The method associates user stories with the corresponding business process model activity element. Method We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process model can be used to infer information about the execution order and integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of association granularity: a user story can be more abstract, approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of these three levels. Results Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of user stories when associated business process models are available. Conclusions We addressed a problem which arises from managing user stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing context of a user story. Our method contributes to the discipline of conceptual modeling in agile development. Our experiment provides empirical insight into requirement dependencies.

Particularly, electric cars represent this case and complexity is not only driven by product variants, but also by an increasing proportion and importance of software applications in value creation. However, the reference processes to develop these automotive products were established two decades ago. The reference process which is used by automotive \\{OEMs\\} is the integrated product and process development which bases on the concept of simultaneous engineering. In contrast to conventional cars with a combustion engine, product architectures for electric vehicles can be planned differently with the lithium-ion battery as the central and most expensive component and can be designed with more degrees of freedom. Such a product architecture can also be simplified that complexity is reduced for both, the product and the development process. Changes in terms of product architecture also imply that there are changes in the technological knowledge of the automotive OEM. It must focus on key technologies. Consequently, suppliers have got the chance to advance from suppliers, who produce products on demand, to technological experts, who provide technology platforms. The development process, moreover, has to evolve from typical stage-gate-concepts to a more agile process tailored to suit continuously changing requirements to fulfil the demand for a fast product qualification for series production. So, even shorter innovation cycles and time-to-market periods can be reached. Certainly, this has an effect on financial aspects with the objective to design the organisational process as lean as possible. Finally, the more agile process design serves an optimised ratio between engineering expenses and customer value - called Return on Engineering. It is the central paradigm to which process design and methods for product development need to adhere.

The introduction of procedural code sets for whole-exome and genome sequencing is a milestone toward financially sustainable clinical implementation; however, achieving reimbursement is currently a major challenge. As part of a prospective quality-improvement initiative to implement the new code sets, we adopted Agile, a development methodology originally devised in software development. We implemented eight functionally distinct modules (request review, cost estimation, preauthorization, accessioning, prebilling, testing, reporting, and reimbursement consultation) and obtained feedback via an anonymous survey. We managed 50 clinical requests (January to June 2015). The fraction of pursued-to-requested cases (n = 15/50; utilization management fraction, 0.3) aimed for a high rate of preauthorizations. In 13 of 15 patients the insurance plan required preauthorization, which we obtained in 70% and ultimately achieved reimbursement in 50%. Interoperability enabled assessment of 12 different combinations of modules that underline the importance of an adaptive workflow and policy tailoring to achieve higher yields of reimbursement. The survey confirmed a positive attitude toward self-organizing teams. We acknowledge the individuals and their interactions and termed the infrastructure: human pipeline. Nontechnical barriers currently are limiting the scope and availability of clinical genomic sequencing. The presented human pipeline is one approach toward long-term financial sustainability of clinical genomics.

For this purpose an integrated evaluation approach has been developed by Fraunhofer \\{IPK\\} to manage the lifecycle of an innovation initiative in terms of implementation progress and operational performance in a sustainable way. The Evaluation System follows a multi-perspective approach that involves internal and external stakeholders by applying a combination of evaluation instruments including key performance indicators, self-assessment- and audit procedures as well as monitoring- and reporting tools. As a main output of the Evaluation System, specific improvement suggestions and action plans can be derived to react agile on potential challenges.

The need for such features currently prevent the exploitation of reconfigurable robotics in manufacturing. The current work presents an approach to design and configure reconfigurable robots for the high precision manufacturing industry. The work proposes a configuration algorithm that enables the identification of the robot architectures and the related reconfigurability features by selecting the type and number of robot modules to be implemented over time in order to better accomplish a number of production requirements. Particularly, assuming the robot will work by utilising a finite set of robotic modules, the algorithm determines the set of modules to form the arm and the ones to be allocated in the robot storage for possible usage over time. Results show a number of benefits such as a robotic chain with customised reaching and degrees of freedom with a reduced cost by performing an accurate module selection and configuration; this should lead the robot users to prefer reconfigurable robots to commercial rigid catalogue solutions proposed by robot manufacturers.

Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in flight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of flight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-specific responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and flight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p &lt; 0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and flight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efficiently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.

One way for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to become more agile, is to incorporate industrial robots in their production processes; larger enterprises already use this versatile piece of equipment for large batch sizes. To do so, a new perspective and approach is required, tailored to dynamic manufacturing systems in which production systems and components can be easily reconfigured, altered, swapped or replaced. A modular system architecture was developed within project \\{SInBot\\} upon which challenges in dynamic cooperation between robots and humans were projected. The developed system uses decentralized control and distributed intelligence, linked through an extensible, flexible, and fault-tolerant communication architecture. The rapidly growing complexity of traditional systems is compared to its decentralized counterpart to illustrate some of the many advantages of this new system architecture. A manufacturing scenario analogue is discussed and the approach to verify the performance of inner-system components, as well as the benefits of this approach. Key challenges that are encountered in implementing the cooperation into the current industrial environments are identified and projected upon the verification system.

Volatile and uncertain renewable energy sources cause high fluctuations in electricity prices and thus usually higher costs for the final user such as a melt shop. This paper presents an integrated production and electricity optimization system that can help the melt shop to adjust its production schedule to volatile electricity prices and thus lower its costs. An existing production scheduling optimization system based on a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming model has been further developed to account for electricity costs as well. It deploys an intelligent heuristics which decomposes the overall optimization problem into several sub-problems of smaller size in order to achieve faster and more robust solution. The electricity-aware optimization system has been successfully tested and implemented in a melt shop where it managed to reduce electricity costs by around 3%. At the same time, the system has improved coordination between different production stages, and thus made the entire melt shop more flexible, agile and responsive to unexpected events. The system has also been recognized as a very useful tool for running various simulations, what-if analysis and business scenarios on the melt shop in order to identify bottlenecks and further increase its production rate.

However, this activity may be misleading when a test suite is insufficiently robust for revealing faults. Particularly, refactoring faults can be tricky and difficult to detect. Coverage analysis is a standard practice to evaluate fault detection capability of test suites. However, there is usually a low correlation between coverage and fault detection. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on the use of coverage data of mostly impacted code elements to identify shortcomings in a test suite. We consider three real open source projects and their original test suites. The results show that a test suite not directly calling the refactored method and/or its callers increases the chance of missing the fault. Additional analysis of branch coverage on test cases shows that there are higher chances of detecting a refactoring fault when branch coverage is high. These results give evidence that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by refactoring edits. Furthermore, we propose a statistic model that evidences the correlation of coverage over certain code elements and the suite's capability of revealing refactoring faults.

A case study in seafood production is analysed from an end-to-end perspective in the flow of seafood from Norway to Japan to investigate how practitioners describe trading and the terminology used on trading embedded across the complete supply network. Four subcases that focus on how goods are traded are studied. Two subcases consider raw material supply, aquaculture-supplied salmon and wild-caught pelagic fish. The third subcase concerns the export of frozen mackerel to Japan, and the final subcase concerns seafood trading at a regional wholesale market in Japan. Analysis is based on the view that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are interdependent. The fundamental importance of sequential interdependencies in seafood production is demonstrated. The four subcases are first analysed individually, applying relational contracting theory to understand patterns of exchange leading to transfer of title at markets. Developed relationships and trust, but also an acceptance of partner switching, characterizes exchange in all four market-related subcases. An understanding of how these loosely coupled markets may be viewed as aligned is developed. Markets emerge as nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange facilitate agile seafood distribution.

The importance of patient preferences and values increases in shared decision making especially when the cost of cancer care is continuing its steep rise. As our understanding of cancer systems biology increases, we are justifiably optimistic about therapeutic improvements but recognize that this has complicated the traditional Food and Drug Administration approval of drug indications based on organ-specific cancer for a particular drug. Dynamic and agile clinical guidelines that reflect a rapidly changing knowledge base for decision-making support are needed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has been working on three initiatives to tackle these complex issues. The first initiative is ASCO's collaboration with other international organizations to create a framework to assess drugs for the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List, including nongenerics. The second initiative aims to define clinically meaningful outcomes as precision medicine expands the definition of cancers, leading to increased demand for the use of targeted drugs as single agents or in combination. The third initiative is ASCO's value framework, published in 2015, focusing on patient-physician shared decision making. The framework incorporates three parameters: 1) the meaningfulness of the clinical benefit, 2) the toxicity of the treatment, and 3) the patient's financial out-of-pocket cost. \\{ASCO\\} is concerned about the rising cost of cancer care when the clinical complexity and the pace of change in oncology are accelerating, and it is committed to help improve patient outcomes and value in cancer care as well as to engage the broader health care community in a process of collaborative improvement.

This highly distributed computing environment can be used to provide ultra-low latency, precise positional awareness and agile applications, which could significantly improve user experience. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to consider next-generation paradigms such as Information-Centric Networking and Cloud Computing, integrated with the upcoming 5th Generation networking access. A cohesive end-to-end architecture is proposed, fully exploiting Information-Centric Networking together with the Mobile Follow-Me Cloud approach, for enhancing the migration of content-caches located at the edge of cloudified mobile networks. The chosen content-relocation algorithm attains content-availability improvements of up to 500% when a mobile user performs a request and compared against other existing solutions. The performed evaluation considers a realistic core-network, with functional and non-functional measurements, including the deployment of the entire system, computation and allocation/migration of resources. The achieved results reveal that the proposed architecture is beneficial not only from the users' perspective but also from the providers point-of-view, which may be able to optimize their resources and reach significant bandwidth savings.

This moment control unit is employed as an actuator for the satellite attitude control. It contains four control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) to realize the rapid attitude maneuver and a vibration isolation system for each CMG. This unit can not only reduce the required electronics for each \\{CMG\\} and thus the weight, but also improve the stability of the satellite attitude. The design of the structure is presented first. This structure not only holds and protects the CMGs, but also isolates the vibrations caused by each CMG. Then, a dynamic model of a single \\{CMG\\} with a vibration isolation system is formulated, and the time- and frequency-domain characteristics of this dynamic model are discussed. Numerical simulations of a satellite attitude control example are then used to evaluate the system. The new moment control unit occupies less volume than previous designs, and the results show that the new design improves satellite pointing performance because of the vibration isolation. "}}]
