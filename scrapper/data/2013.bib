By combining the widely accepted Agile Methods, Model-Driven Developments and User-Centred Design it allows us to develop high-quality interactive applications. As a main characteristic, it plans and organises the software project as a series of iterations that are guided by the User Objectives in an agile and user-centred manner. At each iteration, the software development work can be distributed to different teams according to some developmental and integration activities. Each activity is driven by models that are validated by a multidisciplinary team composed of developers and users. The requirements are incrementally collected and formalised by means of models based on user-centred design. Besides, the Semantically Enriched Human–Computer Interaction model is proposed to speed up project validation. This model enriches a human–computer interaction model with some visual characteristics and the application semantic. Thus, the enriched model provides enough information to generate prototypes so users and developers can easily validate this model. Diagram project is a real case study that is used to illustrate the application of the InterMod methodology through the whole paper. "

With it's roots in industrial manufacturing and, later, industrial product development, it would seem natural that \{LPD\} would adapt well to large-scale development projects of increasingly software-intensive products, such as in the automotive industry. However, it is not clear what kind of experience and results have been reported on the actual use of lean principles and practices in software development for such large-scale industrial contexts. This was the motivation for this study as the context was an ongoing industry process improvement project at Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Truck Corporation. The objectives of this study are to identify and classify state of the art in large-scale software development influenced by \{LPD\} approaches and use this established knowledge to support industrial partners in decisions on a software process improvement (SPI) project, and to reveal research gaps and proposed extensions to \{LPD\} in relation to its well-known principles and practices. For locating relevant state of the art we conducted a systematic mapping study, and the industrial applicability and relevance of results and said extensions to \{LPD\} were further analyzed in the context of an actual, industrial case. A total of 10,230 papers were found in database searches, of which 38 papers were found relevant. Of these, only 42 percent clearly addressed large-scale development. Furthermore, a majority of papers (76 percent) were non-empirical and many lacked information about study design, context and/or limitations. Most of the identified results focused on eliminating waste and creating flow in the software development process, but there was a lack of results for other \{LPD\} principles and practices. Overall, it can be concluded that research in the much hyped field of lean software development is in its nascent state when it comes to large scale development. There is very little support available for practitioners who want to apply lean approaches for improving large-scale software development, especially when it comes to inter-departmental interactions during development. This paper explicitly maps the area, qualifies available research, and identifies gaps, as well as suggests extensions to lean principles relevant for large scale development of software intensive systems.

Since expert knowledge is mostly tacit, the acquisition and sharing of tacit knowledge along with the development of a transactive memory system (TMS) are significant factors in effective software teams. Objective We seek to enhance our understanding human factors in the software development process and provide support for the agile approach, particularly in its advocacy of social interaction, by answering two questions: How do software development teams acquire and share tacit knowledge? What roles do tacit knowledge and transactive memory play in successful team performance? Method A theoretical model describing the process for acquiring and sharing tacit knowledge and development of a \{TMS\} through social interaction is presented and a second predictive model addresses the two research questions above. The elements of the predictive model and other demographic variables were incorporated into a larger online survey for software development teams, completed by 46 software SMEs, consisting of 181 individual team members. Results Our results show that team tacit knowledge is acquired and shared directly through good quality social interactions and through the development of a \{TMS\} with quality of social interaction playing a greater role than transactive memory. Both \{TMS\} and team tacit knowledge predict effectiveness but not efficiency in software teams. Conclusion It is concluded that \{TMS\} and team tacit knowledge can differentiate between low- and high-performing teams in terms of effectiveness, where more effective teams have a competitive advantage in developing new products and bringing them to market. As face-to-face social interaction is key, collocated, functionally rich, domain expert teams are advocated rather than distributed teams, though arguably the team manager may be in a separate geographic location provided that there is frequent communication and effective use of issue tracking tools as in agile teams.

In this research we evaluate the ability of \{CGs\} to support practitioners in identifying the most critical threats and countermeasures. The research method used is participatory action research where \{CGs\} were evaluated in a series of risk analyses on four different telecom products. With Peltier (used prior to the use of \{CGs\} at the company) the practitioners identified attacks with low to medium risk level. \{CGs\} allowed practitioners to identify more serious risks (in the first iteration 1 serious threat, 5 high risk threats, and 11 medium threats). The need for tool support was identified very early, tool support allowed the practitioners to play through scenarios of which countermeasures to implement, and supported reuse. The results indicate that \{CGs\} support practitioners in identifying high risk security threats, work well in an agile software development context, and are cost-effective. "

Members of the PRINCE2, \{PMI\} and agile communities of practice were engaged via local interviews and an international survey.

Agile methods, including Extreme Programming and Scrum, have evolved as “light” approaches that simplify the software development process, potentially leading to increased team productivity. However, little empirical research has examined which factors do have an impact on productivity and in what way, when using agile methods. Objective Our objective is to provide a better understanding of the factors and mediators that impact agile team productivity. Method We have conducted a multiple-case study for 6 months in three large Brazilian companies that have been using agile methods for over 2 years. We have focused on the main productivity factors perceived by team members through interviews, documentation from retrospectives, and non-participant observation. Results We developed a novel conceptual framework, using thematic analysis to understand the possible mechanisms behind such productivity factors. Agile team management was found to be the most influential factor in achieving agile team productivity. At the intra-team level, the main productivity factors were team design (structure and work allocation) and member turnover. At the inter-team level, the main productivity factors were how well teams could be effectively coordinated by proper interfaces and other dependencies and avoiding delays in providing promised software to dependent teams. Conclusion Teams should be aware of the influence and magnitude of turnover, which has been shown negative for agile team productivity. Team design choices remain an important factor impacting team productivity, even more pronounced on agile teams that rely on teamwork and people factors. The intra-team coordination processes must be adjusted to enable productive work by considering priorities and pace between teams. Finally, the revised conceptual framework for agile team productivity supports further tests through confirmatory studies. "

We seek to provide a rich analysis and a deep understanding of three cases in an exploratory study that was carried out in a large and mature company, widely recognized for its excellence and its engagement in outsourced software development. We used in-depth interviews for data collection and grounded theory techniques for data analysis. Our exploration efforts yielded the following findings: (i) understanding requirements dependencies is of paramount importance for the successful deployment of agile approaches in large outsourced projects. (ii) Next to business value, the most important prioritization criterion in the setting of outsourced large agile projects is risk. (iii) The software organization has developed a new artefact that seems to be a worthwhile contribution to agile software development in the large: ‘delivery stories’, which complement user stories with technical implications, effort estimation and associated risk. The delivery stories play a pivotal role in requirements prioritization. (iv) The vendor's domain knowledge is a key asset for setting up successful client-developer collaboration. (v) The use of agile prioritization practices depends on the type of project outsourcing arrangement. Our findings contribute to the empirical software engineering literature by bringing a rich analysis of cases in agile and distributed contexts, from a vendor's perspective.

A large number of companies have adapted themselves with Agile processes, which, although, promise rapid software development, pose a huge burden on the development teams for continual decision making and expert judgement, when estimating the size of the software components to be developed at each iteration. COSMIC, on the other hand, is an ISO/IEC international standard that presents an objective method of measuring the functional size of the software from user requirements. However, its measurement process is not compatible with Agile processes, as \{COSMIC\} requires user requirements to be formalised and decomposed at a level of granularity where external interactions with the system are visible to the human measurer. This time-consuming task is avoided by agile processes, leaving it with the only option of quick subjective judgement by human measurers for size measurement that often tends to be erroneous. In this article, we address these issues by presenting an approach to approximate \{COSMIC\} functional size from informally written textual requirements demonstrating its applicability in popular agile processes. We also discuss the results of a preliminary experiment studying the feasibility of automating our approach using supervised text mining. "

Given the focus on teamwork, is the agile technology what really matters, or do general team factors, such as cohesion, primarily account for a team’s success? Perhaps the more specific software engineering team factors, for example the agile development method’s collective ownership and code management, are decisive. Objective To assess the contribution of agile methodology, agile-specific team methods, and general team factors in the performance of software teams. Method We studied 40 small-scale software development teams which used Extreme Programming (XP). We measured (1) the teams’ adherence to \{XP\} methods, (2) their use of XP-specific team practices, and (3) standard team attributes, as well as the quality of the project’s outcomes. We used Williams et al.’s (2004a) [33] Shodan measures of \{XP\} methods, and regression analysis. Results All three types of variables are associated with the project’s performance. Teamworking is important but it is the XP-specific team factor (continuous integration, coding standards, and collective code ownership) that is significant. Only customer planning (release planning/planning game, customer access, short releases, and stand-up meeting) is positively related to performance. A negative relationship between foundations (automated unit tests, customer acceptance tests, test-first design, pair programming, and refactoring) is found and is moderated by craftsmanship (sustainable pace, simple design, and metaphor/system of names). Of the general team factors only cooperation is related to performance. Cooperation mediates the relationship between the XP-specific team factor and performance. Conclusion Client and team foci of the \{XP\} method are its critical active ingredients. "

Several factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan, which makes the planning problem difficult. In this paper we formalize the planning problem and propose an optimization model that, given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints, produces a multi-sprint optimal plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. To cope with the inherent flexibility and uncertainty of agile projects, our approach ensures that a baseline plan can be revised and re-optimized during project execution without disrupting it, which we call smooth replanning. The planning problem is converted into a generalized assignment problem, given a linear programming formulation, and solved using the \{IBM\} \{ILOG\} \{CPLEX\} Optimizer. Our model is validated on both real and synthetic projects. In particular, a case study on two real projects confirms the effectiveness of our approach; as to efficiency, for medium-sized problems an exact solution is found in a few minutes, while for large problems a heuristic solution that is less than 1% far from the exact one is returned in a few seconds. Finally, some smooth replanning tests investigate the trade-off between plan quality and stability. "

Objective Find out which challenges the co-existence of agile methods and plan-driven development brings, and how organizations deal with those challenges. Method We present a grounded theory of the challenges of using agile methods in traditional enterprise environments, based on a Grounded Theory research involving 21 agile practitioners from two large enterprise organizations in the Netherlands. Results We organized the challenges under two factors: Increased landscape complexity and Lack of business involvement. For both factors, we identify successful mitigation strategies. These mitigation strategies concern the communication between the agile and traditional part of the organization, and the timing of that communication. Conclusion Agile practices can coexist with plan-driven development. One should, however, keep in mind the context and take actions to mitigate the challenges incurred. "

Agile is not only a subject domain in this work, the teaching method itself is based on Scrum, a popular agile methodology mostly used in software development projects. The method is supported by wikis, a natural platform for simulation of software development environments. The findings from the evaluation indicate that the method enables the creation of “significant learning”, which prepares students for life-long learning and increases their employability. However, the knowledge gains, resulting from wiki interactions are found to be more quantitative than qualitative. The results also imply that despite the active promotion of agile values of communication and feedback, issues regarding the teamwork are still emerging. The engagement of the teacher in the learning and teaching process was discovered to be a motivational factor for the team cohesion. This paper could be of interest to anyone planning to teach agile in the higher education settings, but also to a wider academic community interested in applying agile methods in their own teaching practice.

The challenge is to strike a balance between these extremes in a cost-effective way without compromising quality. Lean strategies could increase competitiveness and profitability by reducing manufacturing costs. Concurrently, agile strategies could enable enterprises to cope with fluctuations. A hybrid lean–agile approach can be an optimal strategic blend for a manufacturing enterprise to meet this challenge. Flexible focused factory, globalized fractal E-manufacturing, innovative value chain strategies, and designing dynamic manufacturing strategies are the four technical pillars of the proposed hybrid lean–agile manufacturing system technical facet. The study shows that hybridizing the lean and agile systems together is technically valid and can be implemented in an industrial setting. It shows how strategically a hybrid lean–agile system can be implemented. It also shows that about one third of the variation in successfully dealing with the sources of competitive advantage in automotive industry can be explained by adopting the technical facet of the hybrid lean–agile manufacturing system.

With the integration of Scrum into the capstone projects, an educational favorable alternative is identified, to previously used design methodologies such as more traditional stage-gate methods as the Waterfall or method or the V-model. This is due to the emphasis on early prototyping, quick feedback and incremental development. It still might not be the favorable method for use in large scale industrial development projects where formal procedures might still be preferred, but the pedagogical advantages in mechatronics education are valuable. Incremental development and rapid prototyping for example gives many opportunities for students to reflect and improve. The Scrum focus on self-organizing teams also provides a platform to practice project organization, by empowering students to take responsibility for the product development process. Among the results of this study, it is shown that it is possible and favorable to integrate Scrum in a mechatronics capstone course and that this can enhance student preparation for a future career as mechatronics designers or product developers. It is also shown that this prepares the students with a larger flexibility to handle the increased complexity in mechatronics product development and thereby enabling the project teams to deliver results faster, more reliable and with higher quality.

In this paper we will examine the primary causes of \{IT\} project management failure stated in modern literature, analyze these causes, and discuss the degree of complexity within the projects from a systemic perspective related to emergence, non- monotonicity, and non-ergodicity. The paper concludes with some conceptual management approaches that respond to these “true” root causes of failure, for applications in agile organizations and beyond. "

Confidence in resulting systems is mostly gained through the use of unit test suites, entrusted to catch regressions as soon as they occur. Consequently, the system can only be as trustworthy as its tests, meaning that measurements of the testsʼ quality is crucial. Whilst mutation testing has been proposed as a means of uncovering test suite defects, it has not been widely adopted in the industry; mainly due to its computational expense and manual effort required by developers investigating unkilled mutants. To make mutation testing affordable, we propose incremental mutation testing — a variation of mutation testing which leverages the iterative nature of agile development by limiting the scope of mutant generation to sections of code which have changed since the last mutation run. Preliminary results show that the number of mutants generated is drastically reduced along with the time required to generate mutants and execute tests against them. "

In order to develop the cost model of highly agile small \{EO\} satellites, a database has been constructed consisting of 49 satellites carrying electro-optical payloads and having a launch mass between 100 kg and 1,000 kg that have either been developed or being developed within a time frame from 1991 to 2011. The cost model of top-down type was developed by analyzing the database statistically. The reliability-corrected \{CER\} (Cost Estimating Relationships) developed in this study implement multiple parameters-based complexity indexes. In addition, the Cost Correction Factor (CCF) and Low Cost Small Satellite (LCSS) adjustment factor were newly introduced as additional parameters for cost estimation. The reliability-corrected \{CERs\} for 26 \{EO\} satellites were used for verification of the cost model developed in this study. It was observed that there are approximately 7% of absolute average errors in the reliability-corrected CER. It is concluded that this cost model can provide cost estimates with a higher accuracy, as compared to conventional cost models such as \{USCM\} and SSCM.

The first \{AGILE\} Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) catalog (Pittori et al., 2009) included a significance-limited (4σ) sample of 47 sources (1AGL), detected with a conservative analysis over the first-year of operations. We present a variability study of the 1AGL sources over the complete \{AGILE\} pointed Observation Blocks (OBs) dataset. In the analysis here reported we used data obtained with an improved full Field of View (FOV) event filter, on a much larger (about 27.5 months) dataset, integrating data on the \{OB\} timescales, mostly ranging between 4 and 30 days. The data processing resulted in an improved source list as compared to the 1AGL one. We present here our results on the variability of some of these sources. "

However, most of these games have been developed more for professional trainings than taking into consideration typical restrictions of university courses (such as, class duration and low financial resources for instructional materials). Therefore, we present a manual paper and pencil game to reinforce and teach the application of \{SCRUM\} in undergraduate computing programmes complementing theoretical lectures. The game has been developed following a systematic instructional design process and based on our teaching experience. It has been applied several times in two undergraduate project management courses. We evaluated motivation, user experience and the game's contribution to learning through case studies on Kirkpatrick's level one based on the perception of the students. First results indicate the potential of the game to contribute to the learning of \{SCRUM\} in an engaging way, keeping students immersed in the learning task. In this regard, the game offers a low-budget alternative to complement traditional instructional strategies for teaching \{SCRUM\} in the classroom. "

These processes occur as a result of cell adhesion, migration, division, differentiation and death, and involve multiple processes acting at the cellular and molecular level. Computational models offer a useful means by which to investigate and test hypotheses about these processes, and have played a key role in the study of cell–cell interactions. However, the necessarily complex nature of such models means that it is difficult to make accurate comparison between different models, since it is often impossible to distinguish between differences in behaviour that are due to the underlying model assumptions, and those due to differences in the in silico implementation of the model. In this work, an approach is described for the implementation of vertex dynamics models, a discrete approach that represents each cell by a polygon (or polyhedron) whose vertices may move in response to forces. The implementation is undertaken in a consistent manner within a single open source computational framework, Chaste, which comprises fully tested, industrial-grade software that has been developed using an agile approach. This framework allows one to easily change assumptions regarding force generation and cell rearrangement processes within these models. The versatility and generality of this framework is illustrated using a number of biological examples. In each case we provide full details of all technical aspects of our model implementations, and in some cases provide extensions to make the models more generally applicable. "

Inherent dispersive behavior is subsumed into the forward transmission of the passive device. Due to this nonlinear phase response, in general to maximize the overall system performance, an agile tuning of the varactor values is demonstrated, taking into account the phase and group delay of s21 parameter. Detailed signal simulation results based on measured data of a testbed are presented. The influence of varying matched impedances on the tuning behavior with different modulation bandwidths is discussed at a center frequency of 1.9 GHz. "

Development of business process models based on the knowledge economy, changing corporate strategy and organization design, and agile enterprise paradigm requires \{BPMS\} technology to support weakly structured business activities and emerging ad-hoc tasks. Increasingly, organizations are expanding the use of \{BPM\} beyond their initial focus on structured processes into more challenging, cross-boundary processes that include more unstructured components. Case management technology allows the modeling of cases in which a business goal is achieved by taking decisions in the context of documents and other content objects. Case management is considered dynamic because it focuses on unstructured and ad- hoc processes. It is likewise a continuing process that involves people, information, processes, and technical tools. Furthermore, it is adaptive and adaptable because it can be used by non-technical users and is versatile in its applications in different situations. With the use of case management, circuitous business processes, fragmented communication, repetitive operations, missing documents, and long approval times can be permanently abolished. "

This paper deals with the study of a new methodology to increase the wind speed and power output of small turbines located in urban areas.

This idea was obtained from the different shapes adopted for the Roof Tops of Buildings at various locations. The methodology used here studies the impact of monoslide roof shape on wind speed using CFD. Majority of buildings in India have Flat Roofs. So, the paper suggests the use of adjustable roof so that the roofs could be tilted at various angles. The present study gives a diagrammatical representation of the new method and an analysis using CFD. Measuring the velocity of wind at an urban location at various altitudes and at various locations of the buildings is a complex task.

Often, they focus on one phase (e.g., acquisition) at the expense of other factors that increase total ownership cost (TOC). Based on several related research projects, we have developed, applied, and evolved an orthogonal framework of strategies for improving Affordability. The framework includes:• Get the best from people (Staffing, Teambuilding, Facilities, Kaizen) • Make tasks more efficient (Tools, Work and Oversight Streamlining, Collaboration Technology) • Eliminate tasks (Lean and Agile Methods, Automation, Model-Based Product Generation) • Eliminate scrap and rework (Early Risk and Defect Elimination, Evidence-Based Decision Gates, Modularity around Sources of Change, Evolutionary Development, …) • Simplify products: \{KISS\} (Risk-Based Prototyping, Value-Based Capability Prioritization, Satisficing vs. Optimizing) • Reuse components (Domain Engineering, Composable Components and Services, Legacy Repurposing) • Reduce O&amp;S costs (Automate Tasks, Design for Maintainability, Streamline Supply Chain, Anticipate/Prepare for Change) • Perform value-based tradespace analysis among the above. The research presented will also summarize the use of calibrated quantitative cost models for reasoning about the strategy elements and their tradeoffs. "

This work presents a discovery mechanism, Stalkers (and its three versions—Floodstalkers, Firestalkers, k -Stalkers), that is able to cooperatively extract implicit knowledge embedded within the network topology and quickly adapt to any changes of resource locations. Stalkers aims at tracing resource migrations by only following links created by recent requestors. This characteristic allows search paths to bypass highly congested nodes, use collective knowledge to locate resources, and quickly respond to dynamic environments. Numerous experiments have shown higher success rate and stable performance compared to other related blind search mechanisms. More specifically, in fast changing topologies, the Firestalkers version exhibits good success rate, and low latency and cost in messages compared to other mechanisms. "

Unfortunately, existing proposals ignore job priorities, which is a very important aspect in \{PSEs\} since it allows accelerating \{PSE\} results processing and visualization in scientific Clouds. We present a new Cloud scheduler based on Ant Colony Optimization, the most popular bio-inspired technique, which also exploits well-known notions from operating systems theory.

In the majority of cases, the issue of security is overlooked by default in these systems, and hence the potential cost and consequences of the materialization of threats could produce catastrophic loss for organizations. Therefore, the early selection of security controls that mitigate risks is a real and important necessity. Nevertheless, there exists an enormous range of \{IT\} security controls and their configuration is a human, manual, time-consuming and error-prone task. Furthermore, configurations are carried out separately from the organization perspective and involve many security stakeholders. This separation makes difficult to ensure the effectiveness of the configuration with regard to organizational requirements. Objective In this paper, we strive to provide security stakeholders with automated tools for the optimal selection of \{IT\} security configurations in accordance with a range of business process scenarios and organizational multi-criteria. Method An approach based on feature model analysis and constraint programming techniques is presented, which enable the automated analysis and selection of optimal security configurations. Results A catalogue of feature models is determined by analyzing typical \{IT\} security controls for \{BPMSs\} for the enforcement of the standard goals of security: integrity, confidentiality, availability, authorization, and authentication. These feature models have been implemented through constraint programs, and Constraint Programming techniques based on optimized and non-optimized searches are used to automate the selection and generation of configurations. In order to compare the results of the determination of configuration a comparative analysis is given. Conclusion In this paper, we present innovative tools based on feature models, Constraint Programming and multi-objective techniques that enable the agile, adaptable and automatic selection and generation of security configurations in accordance with the needs of the organization.

With central management of centre console, Service Composition Optimal Selection (SCOS) and Optimal Allocation of Computing Resources (OACR) are two critical steps for implementing high flexible and agile service provision and resource sharing among sub-enterprises and partner-enterprises under the key technologies of virtualization. However, two steps decision-making are inefficient and cumbersome. To overcome this deficiency, the idea of combining \{SCOS\} and \{OACR\} into one-time decision in one console is first presented in this paper, named Dual Scheduling of Cloud Services and Computing Resources (DS-CSCR). The mutual relations between the upper layer cloud services and the underlying infrastructures and their properties in the private cloud of conglomerate are deeply analyzed. For addressing large-scale DS-CSCR problem, a new Ranking Chaos Optimization (RCO) is proposed. With the consideration of large-scale irregular solution spaces, new adaptive chaos operator is designed to traverse wider spaces within a short time. Besides, dynamic heuristic and ranking selection are introduced to control the chaos evolution in the proposed algorithm. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the new DS-CSCR outperforms the traditional two-level decision making with the improvements in both cloud service composition and computing resource allocation. In addition, \{RCO\} can remarkably give much prominent solutions with low time-consuming and high stability than a few typical intelligent algorithms for solving DS-CSCR in private cloud. With the new DS-CSCR and RCO, cloud services and computing infrastructures can then be quickly combined and shared with high efficient decision. "

Because some of the most important brain responses associated with the sudden onset of an emotional distracter are characterized by their early latency onset and short duration, we addressed this issue by using a temporally agile neural signal capable of detecting and distinguishing them. Specifically, scalp event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while 20 boys with \{ADHD\} combined type and 20 healthy comparison subjects performed a digit categorization task during the presentation of three types of irrelevant, distracting stimuli: arousing negative (A−), neutral (N) and arousing positive (A+). Behavioral data showed that emotional distracters (both A− and A+) were associated with longer reaction times than neutral ones in the \{ADHD\} group, whereas no differences were found in the control group. \{ERP\} data revealed that, compared with control subjects, boys with \{ADHD\} showed larger anterior \{N2\} amplitudes for emotional than for neutral distracters. Furthermore, regression analyses between \{ERP\} data and subjects’ emotional ratings of distracting stimuli showed that only in the \{ADHD\} group, emotional arousal (ranging from calming to arousing) was associated with anterior N2: its amplitude increased as the arousal content of the visual distracter increased. These results suggest that boys with \{ADHD\} are more vulnerable to the distracting effects of irrelevant emotional stimuli than control subjects. The present study provides first data on the neural substrates underlying emotional distractibility in ADHD. "

The p-cycle is pre-configured such that if there is a failure, only the switches at two end nodes need to be reconfigured. In this paper, we extend the p-cycle by allowing cycles to have attached links, called Parasitic Protection Links (PPL), in order to protect paths whose source and destination nodes are not only located on the cycle but also connected by a \{PPL\} to the cycle. A p-cycle with \{PPL\} is named p2-cycle. We address the unicast service protection problem against single-link failures by using p2-cycle in mesh networks for both static and dynamic traffic scenarios. In the static case, the problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We further propose two p2-cycle based heuristic algorithms, Strict Routing Protection (SRP) and Flexible Routing Protection (FRP), to address the dynamic traffic case. The numerical results show that the p2-cycle scheme provides better capacity efficiency than the \{FIPP\} p-cycle scheme in all the traffic scenarios considered and achieves only less than 1% extra total cost over the optimum in COST239, provided by Shared Backup Path Protection (SBPP) approach when the traffic load is high. We also study the failure recovery performance in terms of average number of switch reconfigurations (NOR), and show that the performance of the p2-cycle becomes much better than that of \{SBPP\} and gets close to \{FIPP\} as the traffic demand increases. In the dynamic case, both \{SRP\} and \{FRP\} outperform \{FIPP\} p-cycle schemes in terms of blocking probability in most scenarios considered. In general, the p2-cycle protection scheme outperforms the p-cycle based in terms of capacity efficiencies which being slightly slower in terms of traffic recovery speed. "

The stomach-content analysis showed that P. clarkii is a polytrophic omnivore that feeds on macrophytes, detritus and macroinvertebrates. The trophic diversity of its diet was highest in mid-summer and in smaller crayfish. Chironomidae larvae and Dreissena polymorpha were the most preferred prey, whereas sediment-dwelling taxa were rarely consumed. The number of consumed small and agile prey negatively correlated with the crayfish size, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in diet. A five-week enclosure experiment was used to determine the impact of P. clarkii on the basal levels of a typical littoral food web of cold lakes at different crayfish densities (0, 2.5, and 5 crayfish m−2). The abundance of aquatic snails sharply decreased with increasing crayfish density and conditioned leaf breakdown was up to five times higher in the presence of crayfish than in the control treatment without crayfish. Crayfish also had a negative effect on macrophyte biomass, resulting from both consumption and uprooting. However, the impact mechanisms and outcomes differed among macrophyte species. In the crayfish treatments, the final biomass of the indigenous Myriophyllum spicatum and Chara sp. was significantly reduced relative to the initially stocked biomass, whereas the alien Elodea nuttallii was able to gain biomass. This finding is consistent with an invasional meltdown scenario, in that P. clarkii indirectly facilitated a dominance of E. nuttallii. Overall, the results concordantly suggest that P. clarkii is a keystone species that can profoundly alter recipient communities via direct trophic links and non-consumptive destruction, and may indirectly facilitate other invasive alien species.

Over the last three years the challenge for HumBox has been to act as not only a shared library for its community, but also to change the working practices of individuals in that community by encouraging them to work in a more open way and to actively share their materials and ideas with others. Getting users to engage with and adopt innovative systems is a well-known problem; with the HumBox our approach was to focus on user-experience (UX) design through agile development and ongoing participatory and co-design activities. In this paper we present a mixed-methods evaluation of the success of this engagement over the past three years, focusing especially on the way that users have appropriated the system and its services in order to solve real problems. Our evaluation reveals that for many HumBox users we have been successful in creating a technology that is invisible (meaning beneath the level of notice and concern) and that the result of this is less micro-appropriation (users adopting and using specific features in new ways) and more macro-appropriation (users adopting and adapting the site as a whole). We conclude that in the case of HumBox invisible technology coupled with the social framework of co-design and user engagement activities, has allowed a diffusion of ownership, and created a safe social and technical environment where the community can debate high-level issues, and that this has led to changes in both professional and pedagogical practice.

abstract = "AbstractObjective To determine the perceptions, attitudes and experiences among family caregivers of patients with musculoskeletal diseases (MSD). Methods It is a descriptive, exploratory, qualitative study. Two discussion groups were organized with family caregivers of \{MSD\} patients, representing the caregiver profile: gender (men/women) and age (31–45 years/46–65 years); and patient profiles: \{MSD\} type (rheumatoid arthritis/ankylosing spondylitis), work status (yes or no for the variables housewife, at least 3 episodes of sick leave, patients who abandoned their work, and patients with permanent work disability). A content analysis based on the Grounded Theory was done to detect and explore emerging categories. Results The emerging dimensions were: alterations in daily life activities, need for caregiver support, physical and psychological impact on the caregiver, characteristics of the patient, and several aspects of care. Relevant experiences mentioned were: the diagnosis of a \{MSD\} changes the patient and their family members’ life affecting work, financial, social, psychological and physical spheres, making it necessary help for basic activities of daily living. Early age at onset or severe \{MSDs\} require dedication and effort on the part of caregivers which increases with time. This leads to a great emotional overload on the caregivers, which may be modulated by the support they receive when providing care. Conclusion The primary consequences for caregivers are loss of purchasing power, work problems, social isolation and emotional stress. Programs for effective at-home support need to be developed with streamlined administrative processes to quickly classify the level of disability and provide official assistance. "

abstract = "Abstract The function of sport shoes is to improve sport performance and reduce sports-related injuries. They are commercial products developed by combining sports technology and marketing activities. Numerous studies on research and development, material application, production process improvements, and human physiological measurements for the sport shoe market exist. However, few studies have conducted an in-depth investigation on the design of forms and external appearance for sports shoes. In this study, running shoes are used as the primary research object. In conjunction with Kansei engineering, the correlation between the form of a shoe model and the emotional reaction of consumers is examined in-depth to develop a Kansei prediction system solely for changes in the design of external forms of running shoes. First, the Kansei adjectives for running shoes are obtained and collected using questionnaire methods. Experimental samples of running shoes are developed using the Taguchi experimental design method. Surveys are then conducted using consumer Kansei questionnaires. Dimension reduction is performed on the obtained data using principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). Finally, neural network (NN), PCA-NN, and PLS-NN are used to establish a predictive model. In this study, we observed that \{PLS\} is superior to \{PCA\} in performance on dimension reduction because it considers the Y information variable and encompasses causal relationships when converting the original variable X into a latent variable. Data from the \{PLS\} regression coefficients shows that the form of the sole is the most significant design factor affecting the emotional response of the consumer regarding the overall outer appearance of the running shoe. Because it is difficult to train neural networks (NNs) when numerous variables exist, the modeling efficiencies of \{NN\} with questionnaire data dimension reduction using \{PCA\} and \{PLS\} are compared. The results indicate that because the elements comprising running shoes correlate with consumer image responses, \{PCA\} has a limited ability in reducing dimensions when causal relationships between the variables are disregarded. Therefore, validation results from PCA-NN models are relatively poor. If the correlation between variables is included with PLS, the predictive capability of \{NNs\} can be effectively enhanced. The results show that PLS-NN performance in training and validation is superior to PCA-NN. Furthermore, the best predictive result is obtained from the Kansei adjective pair “clumsy-agile.” The prediction accuracy rate of the PLS-NN model improves with increasing reduction performance for PLS. The predictive system developed using PLS-NN maintains stability or robustness for linear data processing and predictive capability with non-linear data. This allows sports shoe designers to provide the best reference combinations for specific product images when creating conceptual designs of novel shoe appearance. The system can present an appropriate external form of running shoe in the user interface as long as an adjective target value is provided by the designer. "

This implies that the providing company develops an \{IPS2\} consisting of product share, e.g. a highly complex precision machine tool, and service share to increase customer value, strengthen the relationship between customer and provider and finally generate profit. However, providing an \{IPS2\} involves a high degree of organizational effort. The operation of an \{IPS2\} includes the detection of service demands, strategic and operative scheduling of processes and resources, coordination of service and supply network partners and the monitored delivery of service processes. In this paper, an \{IPS2\} Control Architecture for the operation phase is proposed. Then, the function and application area of two software systems, the IPS2-Execution System and the IPS2-Control System, are described and their interaction within the proposed architecture is outlined. Furthermore, the detailed interaction process is illustrated in an application scenario in order to demonstrate the advantages and necessity of both systems and their interdependency. Also, an outlook on further research is given. "

It offers solutions referred to economic, environmental and social aspects providing limitation of resources use (thanks to changes in technology and equipment, especially important for natural and non-renewable resources), higher resources efficiency (thanks to decreased media and materials use, especially important for technical resources) and improved resources exploitation balance resulting in higher cost effectiveness, ecology ad human-centric approach. Agility on the other hand is the approach focused on meeting customers' demand concerning products' structure and logistics. It is a consequence of globalization, innovations in technology, products' lifecycle shortening and growing expectations and requirements of customers. Combining sustainability and agility is a difficult task, however potential results of such combination are key factors of success, including adaptability and flexibility of green and customer-oriented resources and processes. The following paper to present a decision model for resources management including sustainability criteria and meeting agility requirements. "
