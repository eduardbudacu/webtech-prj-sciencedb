Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known of the actual metrics use in Agile teams. Objective The objective of this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the used metrics. Method This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process. Results The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning, progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate. Conclusion The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as they can offer the largest impact to the software industry.

These models differ in their underlying structure prescribing different possible paths to maturity in agile software development, neglecting the fact that agile teams struggle to follow prescribed processes and practices. Our objective, therefore, was to empirically investigate how agile teams evolve to maturity, as a means to conceive a theory for agile software development evolvement that considers agile teams nature. The complex adaptive systems theory was used as a lens for analysis and four case studies were conducted to collect qualitative and quantitative data. As a result, we propose the Progressive Outcomes framework to describe the agile software development maturing process. It is a framework in which people have the central role, ambidexterity is a key ability to maturity, and improvement is guided by outcomes agile teams pursue, instead of prescribed practices.

Whereas software was once considered a detail to be bundled, it has since become an intricate and interdependent part of most products. The advancement of software increases the uncertainty and the interdependencies between development tasks and artifacts. A key success factor is good requirements engineering (RE), and in particular, the challenges of effectively and efficiently coordinating and communicating requirements. Objective In this work we present a lightweight \\{RE\\} framework and demonstrate and evaluate its industrial applicability in response to the needs of a Swedish automotive company for improving specific problems in inter-departmental requirements coordination and communication in large-scale development of software-intensive systems. Method A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews. Results The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and communicating requirements identified at the case company. However, other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and competences in the early development phases, were identified when using the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken. Conclusion Overall, the experience from using the framework and the positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems related to coordination and communication of requirements. Based on the promising results, our industrial partner has decided upon further validations of the framework in a large-scale pilot program.

Objective This paper aims to understand how software developers experience the continuous adaptation of performance in a modern, highly volatile environment using Lean and Agile software development methodology. This understanding can be used as a basis for guiding formation and maintenance of high-performing teams, to inform performance improvement initiatives, and to improve working conditions for software developers. Method A qualitative multiple-case study using thematic interviews was conducted with 16 experienced practitioners in five organisations. Results We generated a grounded theory, Performance Alignment Work, showing how software developers experience performance. We found 33 major categories of performance factors and relationships between the factors. A cross-case comparison revealed similarities and differences between different kinds and different sizes of organisations. Conclusions Based on our study, software teams are engaged in a constant cycle of interpreting their own performance and negotiating its alignment with other stakeholders. While differences across organisational sizes exist, a common set of performance experiences is present despite differences in context variables. Enhancing performance experiences requires integration of soft factors, such as communication, team spirit, team identity, and values, into the overall development process. Our findings suggest a view of software development and software team performance that centres around behavioural and social sciences.

Hybrid development models, referred to as user-centered agile software development (UCASD) in this article, propose to combine the merits of both approaches in order to design software that is both useful and usable. Objective This paper aims to capture the current state of the art in \\{UCASD\\} approaches and to derive generic principles from these approaches. More specifically, we investigate the following research question: Which principles constitute a user-centered agile software development approach? Method We conduct a systematic review of the literature on UCASD. Identified works are analyzed using a coding scheme that differentiates four levels of UCASD: the process, practices, people/social and technology dimensions. Through subsequent synthesis, we derive generic principles of UCASD. Results We identified and analyzed 83 relevant publications. The analysis resulted in a comprehensive coding system and five principles for UCASD: (1) separate product discovery and product creation, (2) iterative and incremental design and development, (3) parallel interwoven creation tracks, (4) continuous stakeholder involvement, and (5) artifact-mediated communication. Conclusion Our paper contributes to the software development body of knowledge by (1) providing a broad overview of existing works in the area of UCASD, (2) deriving an analysis framework (in form a coding system) for works in this area, going beyond former classifications, and (3) identifying generic principles of \\{UCASD\\} and associating them with specific practices and processes.

Objective The present study aims to provide a deep insight into the current capabilities and future trends of software support for agile \\{RE\\} practices based on user stories. Method A comparative qualitative study of a set of agile software tools has been conducted according to the following criteria: coverage of the key functional requirements, support for basic agile \\{RE\\} concepts and practices, and user satisfaction with the tool. The criteria for tool selection were: diversity of software tools, high rating on the user-stories community Web site (http://www.userstories.com), and availability for review. Results The results show a generally good coverage of key functional requirements related to management of user stories and epics, high-level release planning and low-level iteration planning. On the other hand, user-role modeling and persona support have not been addressed at all, and it has been found that requirements for acceptance testing support were completely covered by only one tool. More importantly, the study has revealed significant differences in the way different tools support agile \\{RE\\} concepts and practices (if at all). Finally, qualitative analysis of user reviews has demonstrated that practitioners prefer tools that are easy to set up, easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to customize, over more sophisticated but simultaneously more demanding tools. Conclusion Although the progress that has been made since the inception of these tools is quite clear, there is still room for improvements in terms of support for various agile \\{RE\\} practices within a specific agile process.

Software quality has been an important topic since the beginning of the software development and production. Many researches have been conducted to discuss how the quality of software is a critical factor to its success [1-5]. Because software became an important part of almost every task in our daily life, having high quality software that meets the users' expectations is important [6]. Software integration is a stage in every software development lifecycle, it is defined as the process to assemble the software components and produce a single product. It has been shown that software integration and integration testing can make more than 40% of the overall project cost, so it is important that they are done efficiently and easily to be able to manage the involved risks [7].

Improvements are observed on the quality and on the customer perception of the end product, while agile methodologies allow for requirement changes even late in the project.

(2) 54% of the participants reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33% mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of effort, after the development phase (on average, 31% of overall project effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases come next and have similar average values (14%, 12%, 12% and 11% respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents (53%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38% and 34%, respectively.

The research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of composing processes for three software development projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable sequence of components. Findings: The main findings indicate that \\{GA\\} is more effective (best results regarding the fitness function) than \\{HC\\} and \\{RS\\} in the search of solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a context. These \\{SBSE\\} results were complemented by the feedback given by specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity, adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager during the decision making in process composition. Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample prevents generalization for other types of projects or different contexts. Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition, since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile, and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase collaboration in software development. Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area. Finally, this work expands the body of knowledge in \\{SBSE\\} to the field of software process which has not been properly explored by former research.

This question has been addressed by conducting an in depth review of current literature and by interviewing professionals from different aerospace companies. The results are a set of key findings regarding software impact in aerospace industry, and a monitoring proposal based in a traditional business intelligence architecture. By incorporating condition monitoring methodologies into the software application portfolio of the enterprise, benefits in maintenance budget allocation and risk avoidance are expected, thanks to a more precise and agile way of processing business data.

Method: The method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches. These studies have been identified as case studies regarding the empirical research, as solution proposals regarding the research type, and as evaluation studies regarding the research validation type. Most of the papers used method engineering to implement tailoring and were not specific to any agile method on their scope. Conclusion: Most of agile methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables.

Inter-organisational agile projects possess unique attributes. They involve multiple stakeholders from different organisational contexts and are thus characterised by competing priorities. Team members also lack a mutual awareness of what constitutes work. These issues make the collaboration between project teams challenging. Meanwhile collaboration between usability designers and agile project teams is an integral part of the integration of usability activities into agile development projects. We carried out an interpretive case study on a large inter-organisational agile development project to examine how usability designers and agile project teams collaborate in this project type. Results showed integration goals were achieved through five tactics deployed by the usability designers. These tactics were negotiating inclusion; upward influencing, placating expert users, establishing credibility and diffusing designs. The implications of these findings are summarised in the form of three propositions that pertain to how usability designer-agile project team collaborations might be organised in agile development projects. Further, the role of the usability designer in ensuring the integration of usability activities is also emphasised.

In this research, the particular issue of compliance of Agile Software Development Methodologies (SCRUM, XP, and UPEDU) and the new ISO/IEC 29110 standard is studied. Because the new standard is focused on the software process in very small software development companies or small software project teams in the range from 1 to 25 people, and the Agile Software Development Methodologies (ASDMs) are primarily for same targets, this study is important.

Previous studies on release planning have focused on plan-driven optimization models. Unfortunately, solving the release planning problem mechanistically is difficult in an agile development context. Objective We describe how a release planning method was employed in two case projects in F-Secure, a large Finnish software company. We identify the benefits which the projects gained from the method, and analyze challenges in the cases and improvements made to the method during the case projects. Method We observed five release planning events and four retrospectives and we conducted surveys in the first two events. We conducted six post-project interviews. We conjoined the observation notes, survey results and interviews and analyzed them qualitatively and quantitatively. Results The focal point of the method was release planning events where the whole project organization gathered to plan the next release. The planning was conducted by the development teams in close collaboration with each other and with the other stakeholders. We identified ten benefits which included improved communication, transparency, dependency management and decision making. We identified nine challenges which included the lacking preparation and prioritization of requirements, unrealistic schedules, insufficient architectural planning and lacking agile mindset. The biggest improvements to the method were the introduction of frequent status checks and a big visible planning status board. Conclusion The release planning method ameliorated many difficult characteristics of the release planning problem but its efficiency was negatively affected by the performing organization that was in transition from a plan-driven to an agile development mindset. Even in this case the benefits clearly outweighed the challenges and the method enabled the early identification of the issues in the project.

Requirements engineering and agile methods share common grounds as they both focus on stakeholder collaboration. The key issue is finding a way to study collaboration driven by requirements in geographically distributed agile teams. In this paper, we aim to propose a framework to study collaboration driven by requirements among agile teams and determine the impact of their collaboration patterns on the iteration performance. We define collaboration in terms of communication as information exchange among members, and awareness knowledge of others. Two case studies were conducted to examine communication and awareness network patterns among distributed agile teams. Data were collected through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and onsite observation. The findings revealed that the framework aids in determining the core members, collaboration trends, clustering tendency, communication and awareness reciprocity of the teams, small worldliness and centralisation behaviour of the networks and iteration performance of the agile teams.

Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an \\{IT\\} phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

Organizations' ability to adapt to the fast changing conditions depending on the differing requirements of the customers, depend to a great extend on their ability to become agile. Since change and ambiguity always exist and always will in future, the necessity of the organizations to understand these changes in environment conditions quickly and to be able to respond gains importance every passing day. This requirement provides the wide spreading of agile manufacturing philosophy in organizations. Organizations, due to agile manufacturing, will be able to have the chance of turning the ambiguities in the environment to possibilities. Today, accessing correct and more detailed information became possible however another problem has arisen. This problem is the management of large numerical data stacks and their becoming meaningful. The work of turning raw data into information or making them meaningful can be made with data warehouse and business intelligence tools (data mining, inquiry-reporting, OLAP). At the stage of quickly accessing and using data which will form the basis of agile manufacturing work, creation of data warehouses and using them by integrating into organization information system will be useful. In this work, information is tried to be provided with the literature scanning about the possibility of usage of data warehouse and data base architecture during agile manufacturing process and with business intelligence tools.

There is a need to model agile enterprise architecture artefacts both at the high and low detailed level for a particular context. ArchiMate is relatively a new high-level architecture modelling standard. There is a growing interest amongst organisations in applying ArchiMate for high-level agile enterprise architecture modelling. However, organisations are unsure how to effectively apply ArchiMate at high-level and integrate it with their existing low detailed level modelling standards in practice for supporting end-to-end agile enterprise architecture modelling. Objective This paper evaluates the applicability and integration of high-level ArchiMate modelling standard with the existing low-level modelling standards such as \\{BPMN\\} (Business Process Model and Notation), \\{UML\\} (Unified Modelling Language), \\{FAML\\} (FAME [Framework for Agent-Oriented Method Engineering] Language), SoaML (Service Oriented Architecture Modelling Language), and \\{BMM\\} (Business Motivation Model). Method A qualitative questionnaire-based evaluation criteria has been developed based on the well-known and comprehensive The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). The evaluation criteria has been applied to evaluate the applicability and integration of the selected six modelling standards from the business, application, infrastructure and extension perspectives. Results Each modelling standard is different in scope. A single modelling standard usually does not provide the kind of support required by the agile enterprise architecture modelling. Based on the review results, a hybrid enterprise architecture modelling approach is proposed. This paper demonstrates the application of the proposed hybrid approach with the help of an agile enterprise architecture modelling case study. Conclusion It is concluded that the ArchiMate does not replace the existing low-level modelling standards, rather it can be used in conjunction with low-level modelling standards. This calls for the adoption of hybrid and integrated approach for agile enterprise architecture modelling.

To facilitate agile development of information systems, this paper offers three contributions. First, we introduce the concept of evolvability as a model quality characteristic. Evolvability refers to the expected implications of future model refactorings, both in terms of complexity of the required database evolution algorithm and in terms of the expected volume of data to evolve. Second, we propose extending the agile development cycle by using database profiling information to suggest adaptations to the conceptual model to improve performance. For every software release, the database profiler identifies and analyses navigational access patterns, and proposes model optimisations based on data characteristics, access patterns and a cost-benefit model. Based on an experimental evaluation of the profiler we discuss why the quality of conceptual models can generally benefit from profiling and how performance measurements convey semantic information. Third, we discuss the flow of semantic information when developing and using information systems. Beyond these contributions, we also make a case for using object databases in agile development environments. However, most of the presented concepts are also applicable to other database paradigms.

However, reality frequently feed surprises into real estate development projects, creating needs for iterations, where the projects need to be re-defined. We also review agile methods used in IT-projects. The logic in these methods is iterative.This iterative aspect in IT-projects is relevant to real estate development projects as well. This means that real estate development projects have similarities with IT-projects, where the need for iterative development has contributed to the development of agile methods.

In addition, supplier constraints and changes in the law for example makes it necessary for these enterprises to adapt continuously their manufacturing and assembly operations. The customization of products is increasing, and at same time, concepts of series and mass production are declining. This motivate large enterprises but also small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to apply concepts of flexible and agile manufacturing and assembly systems to remain competitive and to react quickly to market changes and consumers' preferences. The aim of this research is to develop a systematically design approach for such systems focusing on \\{SME\\} requirements which were carried out by a questionnaire survey of a sample of several manufacturing \\{SMEs\\} in Italy.

Traditional strategies were based on the principle of economies of scale, which resulted in excess of waste and difficulty of reconfiguration. Global competition necessitates formulating efficient and effective paradigms in response to the global economies to improve the overall performance. Lean and agile manufacturing have been widely adopted in recent years' enterprises. Leanness mainly leads to eliminating the non-value added activities while agility focuses on leads to market responsiveness. This paper discusses the leanness and agility definitions, factors, paradigms, differences, and combination. A hierarchic framework is presented which can be used to measure the leanness, agility, leagility, and overall performance of an enterprise, further, to compare different enterprises. This enables using the multi-criteria decision making methods especially \\{AHP\\} and ANP. Levels of leanness and agility can be fed as input to define a variety of enterprises. Moreover, a different view is introduced for general features of an efficient/effective manufacturing organization irrespective to the definitions of leanness and agility.

More than a million cricketers play cricket daily in India alone and aspire to become professional cricketers. Cricket Talent identification and enhancement is a challenging problem due to lack of quality coaches, meagre infrastructural facilities, and poor linkages of coaching academies &amp; cricket authorities. In India, the problem is even tougher as the majority of the population resides in villages. Many of talented players do not get timely recognition of cricket boards' authorities thus amounting to waste of talent. Many keep on pursuing cricket despite of being non-talented. Due to lack of application of appropriate scientific methods the selection process is also criticized as biased by many. In this paper, we present a web based system viz. Cricket Talent Identification, Enhancement and Selection (C-TIES) for addressing the above issues. C-TIES utilize a cricket talent knowledgebase of experts' opinions aggregated by applying \\{OWA\\} Aggregation Operator and Relative Fuzzy Linguistic Quantifier (RFLQ). The C-TIES system classifies the cricket talent level of an enthusiast into five different classes by applying Normalized Adequacy Coefficient (NAC). The Talent Enhancement and Talent Selection subsystems also uses appropriate algorithms based on OWA, \\{RFLQ\\} and \\{NAC\\} to respectively enable identification of weaknesses in a player and select most talented n-players from a larger group of players. Thus, system reduces the time for identifying weaknesses and also provides a relatively better unbiased selection method for short listing players.

Existing planning methods all suggest that research and analysis should be the first phase, followed by strategy, smart goals and a detailed action plan, and ending with an evaluation of the results. These models provide an undesirable illusion of control. That is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders. Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant publics implicates. That is why preference should be given to the view that communication is not so much communication between two or more actors but is a multi-way diachronic process of ongoing constructions of meanings in which one cannot foresee who is - or will be - involved, in what way, and what the results will be. To be successful, a more flexible planning method is needed in which change is a defining part during the process. Scrum is such a method. To make it applicable in public relations, this agile method, well-known in IT, needed to be expanded by supplementing theory on communication, change and reflectivity, and by enrichment of the common notion of evaluation.

Research however has historically taken the perspective that stochastic demand is stationary therefore limiting its impact for practitioners. Manufacturers require schedules for multiple products that decide the quantity to be produced over a required time span. This work investigated the challenges for production in the framework of a single manufacturing line with multiple products and varying demand. The nature of varying demand of numerous products lends itself naturally to an agile manufacturing approach. We propose a new algorithm that iteratively refines production windows and adds products. This algorithm controls parallel genetic algorithms (pGA) that find production schedules while minimizing costs. The configuration of such a pGA was essential in influencing the quality of results. In particular providing initial solutions was an important factor. Two novel methods are proposed that generate initial solutions by transforming a production schedule into one with refined production windows. The first method is called factorial generation and the second one fractional generation method. A case study compares the two methods and shows that the factorial method outperforms the fractional one in terms of costs.

The strategy recognizes that traditional DoD methods of requirements development, acquisition oversight, and especially systems engineering are inadequate to produce results in the desired timeframe, in a manner that is receptive to more frequent decision points and opportunities to change direction. In order for these types of systems to evolve and support the type of distributed participation and flexibility that the strategy envisions, they must be designed and (more importantly) specified to expose the necessary interfaces and exhibit sufficient modularity to allow for future growth. This adoption of an open-systems architecture approach represents a potentially significant engineering investment that must be accounted for in acquisition processes, and be made a first-class citizen in planning and scheduling activities. We believe that in order for the U.S. Air Force (and the defense community in general) to truly realize the benefits that come with implementation of agile Capability Development as outlined in the strategy, program offices must: 1) Strive to gain deep, technical knowledge of the system modularity; 2) Specify the critical interfaces to a level of detail to allow capability developers to implement functionality in software; 3) Be able to act as a system integrator to verify and validate that potential component implementations can interoperate successfully within the overall system to accomplish the desired mission.

We contribute a vision for discovery of new steps in adaptive workflow systems, suitability functions that can discover candidate alternatives, and a way forward for sourcing options for decision-makers, without the strong assumptions required by previous work.

These tasks are created as refinements of product backlog items at the beginning of each sprint. However, a project team's understanding of the backlog items' business implications and dependencies may often not be deep enough to identify all necessary tasks this early, so in addition to the tasks defined in the beginning of the sprint, more necessary tasks might be discovered as the sprint progresses, making any attempt at progress estimation or risk management difficult. Objective We strive to enable software teams to achieve a deeper understanding of product backlog items, which should help them to identify a sprint's tasks more reliably and comprehensively, and avoid discovering the need for extra tasks during sprint execution. Method We introduced a project team in a medium-sized software development company to the Interaction Room method, which encourages interdisciplinary communication about key system design aspects among all stakeholders. We observed the team's conduct in the sprint planning meetings, and tracked early- vs. late-identified tasks across several sprints. Results Before the introduction of our method, the team used to discover on average 26% of a sprint's tasks not at the beginning of the sprint, but later during the course of the sprint. Using the Interaction Room in two separate projects, this ratio dropped to an average of 5% late-discovered tasks. Conclusion Our observations from these projects suggest that increased communication among all stakeholders of a project leads to a more reliable identification of the tasks to be performed in a sprint, and that an Interaction Room can provide appropriate guidance to conduct this team communication in a focused and pragmatic way.

The rule concern is proposed, and the core and cross cutting concerns of the aspect-oriented approach are included. The rule concern is extracted from business rules included in business processes and services. The rule concern is classified into process rule aspects and service rule aspects according to the level of the rule. In the proposed approach, the system is modularized into core, cross cutting and rule concerns by the separation of concerns, and they are maintained independently. Therefore, the adaptability, reusability, and maintainability of the service system will be enhanced.

Total Quality Management (TQM) provides several quality oriented tools and techniques which, in the event of things, are not always applicable. The increased use of Information Technology (IT) in manufacturing means increased data availability and improved potential for knowledge extraction. Exploiting this knowledge requires data storage and processing facilities with demanding, time consuming sessions for interpretation. Without suitable tools and techniques, knowledge remains hidden in databases. This paper presents a method to help identify root causes of nonconformities (NCs) using a pattern identification approach. Hereby, a general framework, Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), is adapted. This adaptation involves incorporating an economic concentration measure, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), as the data mining algorithm. After presenting the theoretical background, a new methodology is proposed. The suggested approach can be regarded as a quality tool to help make root cause identification of failures simpler and more agile. A case study from the automotive industry is examined using this tool. Results are obtained and presented in the form of matrix based patterns. They suggest that concentration indices help indicate possible root causes of NCs, warranting further investigation in this area.

Methods Ethnographic investigation using the rapid assessment process, a procedure for agile qualitative data collection and analysis, including clinical observation, system demonstrations and analysis and 91 interviews. Results We identified challenges and lessons learned in eight dimensions: (1) hardware and software computing infrastructure, (2) clinical content, (3) human-computer interface, (4) people, (5) workflow and communication, (6) internal organizational policies, procedures, environment and culture, (7) external rules, regulations, and pressures and (8) system measurement and monitoring. Key challenges included performance issues (particularly related to data retrieval), differences in terminologies used across sites, workflow variability and the need for a legal framework. Discussion Based on the challenges and lessons learned, we identified eight best practices for developers and implementers of service-oriented clinical decision support: (1) optimize performance, or make asynchronous calls, (2) be liberal in what you accept (particularly for terminology), (3) foster clinical transparency, (4) develop a legal framework, (5) support a flexible front-end, (6) dedicate human resources, (7) support peer-to-peer communication, (8) improve standards.

This not only holds for processes running within a single enterprise, but also for collaborative scenarios involving distributed and autonomous partners. In particular, if one partner adapts its private process, the change might affect the processes of the other partners as well. Accordingly, it might have to be propagated to concerned partners in a transitive way. A fundamental challenge in this context is to find ways of propagating the changes in a decentralized manner. Existing approaches are limited with respect to the change operations considered as well as their dependency on a particular process specification language. This paper presents a generic change propagation approach that is based on the Refined Process Structure Tree, i.e., the approach is independent of a specific process specification language. Further, it considers a comprehensive set of change patterns. For all these change patterns, it is shown that the provided change propagation algorithms preserve consistency and compatibility of the process choreography. Finally, a proof-of-concept prototype of a change propagation framework for process choreographies is presented. Overall, comprehensive change support in process choreographies will foster the implementation and operational support of agile collaborative process scenarios.

Today, unfortunately, this capability does not exist. Why? Because most suppliers use proprietary information models to represent and share their \\{MSC\\} information! This limits both the semantic precision in the models, which is needed for interoperability, and the level of agility in the supply chains. The availability of a semantically precise and rich reference \\{MSC\\} ontology could address both of these limitations. Based on our prior research, the development of such an ontology will require a semantic mediation process between the proprietary \\{MSC\\} models and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. At the heart of every known, semantic-mediation process is a mapping between a proprietary \\{MSC\\} model and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. Such a mapping must deal with the structural and semantic conflicts between the two. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call canonicalization to address the structural conflicts. The semantic conflicts are addressed using logical mapping. The canonicalization pre-processes the structural representations of the proprietary models and then aligns them using ontology design patterns which are also used in the reference ontology. This simplifies both the mapping problems themselves and the resulting mapping statements considerably. In the paper, we also demonstrate our approach and its benefits in the context of a description-logic-based semantic mediation using the Ontology Web Language (OWL).

In addition to valued input from several vendors, commentary was provided from experienced pharmaceutical representatives, who have installed various continuous platforms. Additionally, a small medium enterprise (SME) perspective was obtained through interviews. A range of technical challenges is outlined, including: the presence of particles, equipment scalability, fouling (and cleaning), technology derisking, specific analytical challenges, and the general requirement of improved technical training. Equipment and analytical companies can make a significant contribution to help the introduction of continuous technology. A key point is that many of these challenges exist in batch processing and are not specific to continuous processing. Backward compatibility of software is not a continuous issue per se. In many cases, there is available learning from other industries. Business models and opportunities through outsourced development partners are also highlighted. Agile smaller companies and academic groups have a key role to play in developing skills, working collaboratively in partnerships, and focusing on solving relevant industry challenges. The precompetitive space differs for vendor companies compared with large pharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no strong consensus around a dominant continuous design, partly because of business dynamics and commercial interests. A more structured common approach to process design and hardware and software standardization would be beneficial, with initial practical steps in modeling. Conclusions include a digestible systems approach, accessible and published business cases, and increased user, academic, and supplier collaboration. This mirrors \\{US\\} \\{FDA\\} direction. The concept of silos in pharmaceutical companies is a common theme throughout the white papers. In the equipment domain, this is equally prevalent among a broad range of companies, mainly focusing on discrete areas. As an example, the flow chemistry and secondary drug product communities are almost entirely disconnected. Control and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT) companies are active in both domains. The equipment actors are a very diverse group with a few major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) players and a variety of SME, project providers, integrators, upstream downstream providers, and specialist PAT. In some cases, partnerships or alliances are formed to increase critical mass. This white paper has focused on small molecules; equipment associated with biopharmaceuticals is covered in a separate white paper. More specifics on equipment detail are provided in final dosage form and drug substance white papers. The equipment and analytical development from laboratory to pilot to production is important, with a variety of sensors and complexity reducing with scale. The importance of robust processing rather than overcomplex control strategy mitigation is important. A search of nonacademic literature highlights, with a few notable exceptions, a relative paucity of material. Much focuses on the economics and benefits of continuous, rather than specifics of equipment issues. The disruptive nature of continuous manufacturing represents either an opportunity or a threat for many companies, so the incentive to change equipment varies. Also, for many companies, the pharmaceutical sector is not actually the dominant sector in terms of sales. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.

The paper highlights these developments, which include internal research programmes, European Union funded research projects, Airbus internal Synergy project. This research includes an \\{EU\\} funded 3 year project HoliDes - Holistic Human Factors and System Design of Adaptive Cooperative Human Machine Systems. Continuous engineering within Airbus has included various corporate and divisional Synergy programs and lean and agile initiatives. As our business is defined by Multiple Portfolio products, supplied from multi countries, the \\{MBSE\\} process had to speed up delivery and reduce overall cost. The Airbus process models needed significant amendment due to products supplied via multiple business lines throughout the company. This problem is exacerbated by varying requirements of four national defence requirements, who impose restrictions on the use of Architectural Frameworks (NAF/MODAF/DODAF) and supporting tools. Our Human System Integration (HSI) is continuing from the initial Human View Architectural Framework research to include the nine \\{HSI\\} domains. These nine domains overlap with our current Human factors research and will now allow us to pull in our Non-functional work into our Systems Engineering lifecycle. This paper highlights the research projects Airbus Space and Defence are incorporating in to our overall strategy, these include internal R&amp;D funding and European Union funded research programs. These research projects have highlighted several areas of interest these include, stochastic modelling with respect to Human System Integration and Human views, verification and analysis of emergent behaviour and non-functional properties, which conforms with our own work on non-functional requirements and finally the use of System of System Formal Methods for parts of the lifecycle.

Therefore, the development of \\{PSS\\} is an extension of traditional engineering design process, which mainly refers to purely tangible products or intangible services into an integrated development process of products and services.

It is based upon methods of Mixed Reality extended by modern industrial technologies to allow natural interaction with virtual prototypes of mechanical or mechatronic systems. It serves as a bridge between physical reality and digital virtuality. The use cases in this paper are based on urban bike mobility. Therefore, three concepts have been worked out to specify main requirements for an urban hybrid bike simulator. The first use case is from the perspective of a bicycle rental, where rental services for the users can be developed, validated, and optimized. The second use case provides the integration of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for the development and validation of mobile services for bicyclists. The third use case is oriented on development and validation of new bicycles and urban mobility concepts like e-bikes, pedelecs, tripelecs and sharing services. Based on these generic use cases the requirements on a hybrid bicycle simulator were derived. Why a bicycle simulator? Well, we are firmly convinced that the future of urban mobility is determined from trends such as ecological rethinking and the desire for sports and healthy life. Furthermore, it is one of the most competitive and agile markets using most innovative materials and manufacturing technologies.

Sustainable harvest of agaves and populations' recovery actions are needed for protecting this and other agave species similarly threatened. Our study aimed to identify mechanisms determining seedling establishment and sapling plants growth of A. potatorum in order to generate information helpful for enhancing populations' growing and reforestation strategies. We hypothesized that (1) A. potatorum plants are spatially associated, probably species-specific, to shrub species, the frequency of facilitation being higher in the earlier stages of life cycle, varying among sites under different stress conditions, (2) germination and seedling survival are higher beneath nurse plants canopy compared with open areas, seeds and plants from a particular site performing better in the original conditions than in others, (3) nurse plants have a positive effect in the net balance of the growth rate of A. potatorum despite the negative effects of shade on carbon gain. We studied the association of A. potatorum with shrub and tree species by analysing their distribution patterns in two sites with contrasting environments (one relatively more xeric than the other). In these site we conducted experiments for testing seedling establishment and growth of agaves. Reciprocal transplanting experiments tested seed germination and seedling survival of agaves in open areas and beneath nurse plants. Two-years-old saplings were planted in open areas and beneath nurse plants to analyse their relative growth rate. We found a significant association of both young and adult plants to nurse plants, some of them being markedly specific. Germination and survival were higher under nurse plants, we also found negative effects of shade in carbon gain, but growth was higher there than in open spaces. We suggest that protection against solar radiation is a main factor influencing the association. Provenance of seeds was significant for germination success and early establishment. Nurse plants are crucial for the establishment of A. potatorum; however, several species may play the role of nurse plants and these may be different among sites. Therefore, rapid identification of nurse plant species in different vegetation types would allow agile actions for successful reforestation. Manual dispersion of seeds beneath canopies of shrubs that are high quality nurse plants, as well as producing sapling agaves in nurseries and transplanting them after two years associated to nurse plants are recommendable techniques for populations' recovery.

The same machine and operator were used for all tests, which lasted 65 h and produced over 100 chip containers. Productivity varied between 13 and 19 tonnes of green chips per scheduled hour, inclusive of all delays. Fuel consumption ranged from 1.8 to 2.8 dm3 of diesel per tonne of green chips. Machine utilization ranged from 68 to 89%, and it was highest in the Nordic trials, due to the use of pre-parked containers, which dramatically reduced the occurrence of interaction delays. Regional differences were only related to operational layout and organization, which set the Nordic trial apart from all others. Knife wear and screen size had a major impact on chipper performance. The same accounted for cut length. Production of small chips is only justified when the market offers premium prices for this assortment.

Objective The objective of this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the used metrics. Method This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process. Results The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning, progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate. Conclusion The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as they can offer the largest impact to the software industry.

Whereas software was once considered a detail to be bundled, it has since become an intricate and interdependent part of most products. The advancement of software increases the uncertainty and the interdependencies between development tasks and artifacts. A key success factor is good requirements engineering (RE), and in particular, the challenges of effectively and efficiently coordinating and communicating requirements. Objective In this work we present a lightweight \\{RE\\} framework and demonstrate and evaluate its industrial applicability in response to the needs of a Swedish automotive company for improving specific problems in inter-departmental requirements coordination and communication in large-scale development of software-intensive systems. Method A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews. Results The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and communicating requirements identified at the case company. However, other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and competences in the early development phases, were identified when using the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken. Conclusion Overall, the experience from using the framework and the positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems related to coordination and communication of requirements. Based on the promising results, our industrial partner has decided upon further validations of the framework in a large-scale pilot program.

Method A comparative qualitative study of a set of agile software tools has been conducted according to the following criteria: coverage of the key functional requirements, support for basic agile \\{RE\\} concepts and practices, and user satisfaction with the tool. The criteria for tool selection were: diversity of software tools, high rating on the user-stories community Web site (http://www.userstories.com), and availability for review.

Objective This study seeks to evaluate, synthesize, and present results on the use of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) in combination with agile software development, and thereafter to give an overview of the topics researched, which includes a discussion of their benefits and limitations, the strength of the findings, and the implications for research and practice. Methods The method applied was a Systematic Literature Review on studies published up to (and including) 2011. Results The search strategy identified 3193 results, of which 81 included studies on the use of \\{CMMI\\} together with agile methodologies. The benefits found were grouped into two main categories: those related to the organization in general and those related to the development process, and were organized into subcategories, according to the area to which they refer. The limitations were also grouped into these categories. Using the criteria defined, the strength of the evidence found was considered low. The implications of the results for research and practice are discussed. Conclusion Agile methodologies can be used by companies to reduce efforts in getting to levels 2 and 3 of CMMI, there even being reports of applying agile practices that led to achieving level 5. However, agile methodologies alone, according to the studies, were not sufficient to obtain a rating at a given level, it being necessary to resort to additional practices to do so.

However, an accurate estimation of effort in this paradigm still remains a dispute in industries. Hence, the industry must be able to estimate the effort necessary for software development using agile methodology efficiently. For this, different techniques like expert opinion, analogy, disaggregation etc. are adopted by researchers and practitioners. But no proper mathematical model exists for this. The existing techniques are ad-hoc and are thus prone to be incorrect. One popular approach of calculating effort of agile projects mathematically is the Story Point Approach (SPA). In this study, an effort has been made to enhance the prediction accuracy of agile software effort estimation process using SPA. For doing this, different types of neural networks (General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) Polynomial Neural Network and Cascade-Correlation Neural Network) are used. Finally performance of the models generated using various neural networks are compared and analyzed.

Software quality has been an important topic since the beginning of the software development and production. Many researches have been conducted to discuss how the quality of software is a critical factor to its success [1-5]. Because software became an important part of almost every task in our daily life, having high quality software that meets the users' expectations is important [6]. Software integration is a stage in every software development lifecycle, it is defined as the process to assemble the software components and produce a single product. It has been shown that software integration and integration testing can make more than 40% of the overall project cost, so it is important that they are done efficiently and easily to be able to manage the involved risks [7]. A software engineering practice called continuous integration (CI) was introduced by Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries to mitigate the risks of software integration, enhance its process and improve its quality [8]. In this research, the principles of \\{CI\\} are identified and applied to a case study in order to analyze their impact on the software development process quality factors.

Traditional software development methods are inflexible and fail to respond on aggressive customer requests. In contrast, agile software methodologies provide a set of practices that allow for quick adaptations matching the modern product development needs. Although the value of the agile methodologies is well proven for small, collocated teams, the research question that this work is addressing refers to the benefits of the agile methodologies on large, distributed projects. With this paper, evidence is provided by the analysis of a case study that agile software development methodologies perform better than traditional methodologies also in large, distributed projects. Improvements are observed on the quality and on the customer perception of the end product, while agile methodologies allow for requirement changes even late in the project. At the same time, building better communication and collaboration in the team as an outcome of following the agile practices, results to enhanced relations between team members and to improved employee satisfaction metrics.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of \\{SE\\} practices conducted in industry. Turkey has a vibrant software industry and it is important to characterize and understand the state of its \\{SE\\} practices. Our objective is to characterize and grasp a high-level view on type of \\{SE\\} practices in the Turkish software industry. To achieve this objective, we systematically designed an online survey with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian and Turkish contexts and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Two hundred and two practicing software engineers from the Turkish software industry participated in the survey. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about \\{SE\\} practices in Turkey and beyond. They also help track the profession of SE, and suggest areas for improved training, education and research. Among the findings are the followings: (1) The military and defense software sectors are quite prominent in Turkey, especially in the capital Ankara region, and many \\{SE\\} practitioners work for those companies. (2) 54% of the participants reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33% mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of effort, after the development phase (on average, 31% of overall project effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases come next and have similar average values (14%, 12%, 12% and 11% respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents (53%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38% and 34%, respectively. (6) The Waterfall and Agile methodologies have slight negative correlations, denoting that if one is used in a company, the other will less likely to be used. The results of our survey will be of interest to \\{SE\\} professionals both in Turkey and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in \\{SE\\} industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in those areas.

The research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of composing processes for three software development projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable sequence of components. Findings: The main findings indicate that \\{GA\\} is more effective (best results regarding the fitness function) than \\{HC\\} and \\{RS\\} in the search of solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a context. These \\{SBSE\\} results were complemented by the feedback given by specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity, adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager during the decision making in process composition. Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample prevents generalization for other types of projects or different contexts. Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition, since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile, and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase collaboration in software development. Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area. Finally, this work expands the body of knowledge in \\{SBSE\\} to the field of software process which has not been properly explored by former research.

Inter-organisational agile projects possess unique attributes. They involve multiple stakeholders from different organisational contexts and are thus characterised by competing priorities. Team members also lack a mutual awareness of what constitutes work. These issues make the collaboration between project teams challenging. Meanwhile collaboration between usability designers and agile project teams is an integral part of the integration of usability activities into agile development projects. We carried out an interpretive case study on a large inter-organisational agile development project to examine how usability designers and agile project teams collaborate in this project type. Results showed integration goals were achieved through five tactics deployed by the usability designers. These tactics were negotiating inclusion; upward influencing, placating expert users, establishing credibility and diffusing designs. The implications of these findings are summarised in the form of three propositions that pertain to how usability designer-agile project team collaborations might be organised in agile development projects.

The security risks associated with developing software following agile methods have been a subject for discussion for some time and continue to evolve. In addition, agile development methods are no longer just confined to software development and may be used to develop any number of web or IT-dependent products and services too that are interdependent with the network security of an enterprise.

It helps to reap the benefits of both agile and distributed development but pose significant challenges and risks. Relatively scanty evidence of research on the risks prevailing in distributed agile development (DAD) has motivated this study. Objective This paper aims at creating a comprehensive set of risk factors that affect the performance of distributed agile development projects and identifies the risk management methods which are frequently used in practice for controlling those risks. Method The study is an exploration of practitioners' experience using constant comparison method for analyzing in-depth interviews of thirteen practitioners and work documents of twenty-eight projects from thirteen different information technology (IT) organizations. The field experience was supported by extensive research literature on risk management in traditional, agile and distributed development. Results Analysis of qualitative data from interviews and project work documents resulted into categorization of forty-five \\{DAD\\} risk factors grouped under five core risk categories. The risk categories were mapped to Leavitt's model of organizational change for facilitating the implementation of results in real world. The risk factors could be attributed to the conflicting properties of \\{DSD\\} and agile development. Besides that, some new risk factors have been experienced by practitioners and need further exploration as their understanding will help the practitioners to act on time.

In this research, the particular issue of compliance of Agile Software Development Methodologies (SCRUM, XP, and UPEDU) and the new ISO/IEC 29110 standard is studied. Because the new standard is focused on the software process in very small software development companies or small software project teams in the range from 1 to 25 people, and the Agile Software Development Methodologies (ASDMs) are primarily for same targets, this study is important.

Specifically, Architecture Technical Debt is regarded as sub-optimal architectural solutions taken to deliver fast that might hinder future feature development, which, in turn, would hinder agility. Objective This paper aims at improving software management by shedding light on the current factors responsible for the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt and to understand how it evolves over time. Method We conducted an exploratory multiple-case embedded case study in 7 sites at 5 large companies. We evaluated the results with additional cross-company interviews and an in-depth, company-specific case study in which we initially evaluate factors and models. Results We compiled a taxonomy of the factors and their influence in the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt, and we provide two qualitative models of how the debt is accumulated and refactored over time in the studied companies. We also list a set of exploratory propositions on possible refactoring strategies that can be useful as insights for practitioners and as hypotheses for further research. Conclusion Several factors cause constant and unavoidable accumulation of Architecture Technical Debt, which leads to development crises. Refactorings are often overlooked in prioritization and they are often triggered by development crises, in a reactive fashion. Some of the factors are manageable, while others are external to the companies. \\{ATD\\} needs to be made visible, in order to postpone the crises according to the strategic goals of the companies.

Previous studies on release planning have focused on plan-driven optimization models. Unfortunately, solving the release planning problem mechanistically is difficult in an agile development context. Objective We describe how a release planning method was employed in two case projects in F-Secure, a large Finnish software company. We identify the benefits which the projects gained from the method, and analyze challenges in the cases and improvements made to the method during the case projects. Method We observed five release planning events and four retrospectives and we conducted surveys in the first two events. We conducted six post-project interviews. We conjoined the observation notes, survey results and interviews and analyzed them qualitatively and quantitatively. Results The focal point of the method was release planning events where the whole project organization gathered to plan the next release. The planning was conducted by the development teams in close collaboration with each other and with the other stakeholders. We identified ten benefits which included improved communication, transparency, dependency management and decision making. We identified nine challenges which included the lacking preparation and prioritization of requirements, unrealistic schedules, insufficient architectural planning and lacking agile mindset. The biggest improvements to the method were the introduction of frequent status checks and a big visible planning status board. Conclusion The release planning method ameliorated many difficult characteristics of the release planning problem but its efficiency was negatively affected by the performing organization that was in transition from a plan-driven to an agile development mindset. Even in this case the benefits clearly outweighed the challenges and the method enabled the early identification of the issues in the project.

Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an \\{IT\\} phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

There is a need to model agile enterprise architecture artefacts both at the high and low detailed level for a particular context. ArchiMate is relatively a new high-level architecture modelling standard. There is a growing interest amongst organisations in applying ArchiMate for high-level agile enterprise architecture modelling. However, organisations are unsure how to effectively apply ArchiMate at high-level and integrate it with their existing low detailed level modelling standards in practice for supporting end-to-end agile enterprise architecture modelling. Objective This paper evaluates the applicability and integration of high-level ArchiMate modelling standard with the existing low-level modelling standards such as \\{BPMN\\} (Business Process Model and Notation), \\{UML\\} (Unified Modelling Language), \\{FAML\\} (FAME [Framework for Agent-Oriented Method Engineering] Language), SoaML (Service Oriented Architecture Modelling Language), and \\{BMM\\} (Business Motivation Model). Method A qualitative questionnaire-based evaluation criteria has been developed based on the well-known and comprehensive The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). The evaluation criteria has been applied to evaluate the applicability and integration of the selected six modelling standards from the business, application, infrastructure and extension perspectives. Results Each modelling standard is different in scope. A single modelling standard usually does not provide the kind of support required by the agile enterprise architecture modelling.

This paper demonstrates the application of the proposed hybrid approach with the help of an agile enterprise architecture modelling case study. Conclusion It is concluded that the ArchiMate does not replace the existing low-level modelling standards, rather it can be used in conjunction with low-level modelling standards. This calls for the adoption of hybrid and integrated approach for agile enterprise architecture modelling.

To facilitate agile development of information systems, this paper offers three contributions. First, we introduce the concept of evolvability as a model quality characteristic. Evolvability refers to the expected implications of future model refactorings, both in terms of complexity of the required database evolution algorithm and in terms of the expected volume of data to evolve. Second, we propose extending the agile development cycle by using database profiling information to suggest adaptations to the conceptual model to improve performance. For every software release, the database profiler identifies and analyses navigational access patterns, and proposes model optimisations based on data characteristics, access patterns and a cost-benefit model. Based on an experimental evaluation of the profiler we discuss why the quality of conceptual models can generally benefit from profiling and how performance measurements convey semantic information. Third, we discuss the flow of semantic information when developing and using information systems. Beyond these contributions, we also make a case for using object databases in agile development environments. However, most of the presented concepts are also applicable to other database paradigms.

Responding to requirements changes is one of the principles of agile methodologies. In this paper we envision the seamless integration of automated verification techniques within agile methodologies, thanks to the support for incrementality. Incremental verification accommodates the changes that occur within the schedule of frequent releases of software agile processes. We propose a general approach to developing families of verifiers that can support incremental verification for different kinds of artifacts and properties. The proposed syntactic-semantic approach is rooted in operator precedence grammars and their support for incremental parsing. Incremental verification procedures are encoded as attribute grammars, whose incremental evaluation goes hand in hand with incremental parsing.

We review real estate development models and project management. Project models typically describe a project process as a linear development, from idea, through decisions, execution and delivery. Real estate development projects are no exception. However, reality frequently feed surprises into real estate development projects, creating needs for iterations, where the projects need to be re-defined. We also review agile methods used in IT-projects. The logic in these methods is iterative.This iterative aspect in IT-projects is relevant to real estate development projects as well. This means that real estate development projects have similarities with IT-projects, where the need for iterative development has contributed to the development of agile methods. We illustrate applications of the model, and corresponding time use in the development process. We find that there is significant variation in the time use, along with need for iterations. The time needed for processing a regulation plan in Norway is found to be minimum about one year, but it may take two years or more.

The increasing demand and the intense competition in market sharing are radically changing the way production systems are designed and products are manufactured pushing, in this way, the emergence of new manufacturing technologies and/or paradigms. This scenario encourages manufacturing companies to invest in new and more integrated monitoring and control solutions in order to optimize more and more their production processes to enable a faster fault detection, reducing down-times during production while improving system performances and throughput along time. In accordance with these needs, the research done under the scope of Self-Learning Production Systems (SLPS) tries to enhance the control together with other manufacturing activities (e.g. energy saving, maintenance, lifecycle optimization, etc.).

Cricket Talent identification and enhancement is a challenging problem due to lack of quality coaches, meagre infrastructural facilities, and poor linkages of coaching academies &amp; cricket authorities. In India, the problem is even tougher as the majority of the population resides in villages. Many of talented players do not get timely recognition of cricket boards' authorities thus amounting to waste of talent. Many keep on pursuing cricket despite of being non-talented. Due to lack of application of appropriate scientific methods the selection process is also criticized as biased by many. In this paper, we present a web based system viz. Cricket Talent Identification, Enhancement and Selection (C-TIES) for addressing the above issues. C-TIES utilize a cricket talent knowledgebase of experts' opinions aggregated by applying \\{OWA\\} Aggregation Operator and Relative Fuzzy Linguistic Quantifier (RFLQ). The C-TIES system classifies the cricket talent level of an enthusiast into five different classes by applying Normalized Adequacy Coefficient (NAC).

The motivation to apply agile methodologies in multi-organizational multi-level environments is based on lean principles that encourage increased visibility of work in progress, limited work in progress, and identification of issues causing blocked work. Current research is focused on formulating the \\{KSS\\} principles and estimating expected performance of the KSS. This paper describes the \\{KSS\\} work flow, Kanban scheduling principles and a simulation model designed to estimate the \\{KSS\\} performance.

Existing planning methods all suggest that research and analysis should be the first phase, followed by strategy, smart goals and a detailed action plan, and ending with an evaluation of the results. These models provide an undesirable illusion of control. That is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders. Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant publics implicates. That is why preference should be given to the view that communication is not so much communication between two or more actors but is a multi-way diachronic process of ongoing constructions of meanings in which one cannot foresee who is - or will be - involved, in what way, and what the results will be. To be successful, a more flexible planning method is needed in which change is a defining part during the process. Scrum is such a method. To make it applicable in public relations, this agile method, well-known in IT, needed to be expanded by supplementing theory on communication, change and reflectivity, and by enrichment of the common notion of evaluation.

Research however has historically taken the perspective that stochastic demand is stationary therefore limiting its impact for practitioners. Manufacturers require schedules for multiple products that decide the quantity to be produced over a required time span. This work investigated the challenges for production in the framework of a single manufacturing line with multiple products and varying demand. The nature of varying demand of numerous products lends itself naturally to an agile manufacturing approach. We propose a new algorithm that iteratively refines production windows and adds products. This algorithm controls parallel genetic algorithms (pGA) that find production schedules while minimizing costs. The configuration of such a pGA was essential in influencing the quality of results. In particular providing initial solutions was an important factor. Two novel methods are proposed that generate initial solutions by transforming a production schedule into one with refined production windows. The first method is called factorial generation and the second one fractional generation method. A case study compares the two methods and shows that the factorial method outperforms the fractional one in terms of costs.

The strategy recognizes that traditional DoD methods of requirements development, acquisition oversight, and especially systems engineering are inadequate to produce results in the desired timeframe, in a manner that is receptive to more frequent decision points and opportunities to change direction. In order for these types of systems to evolve and support the type of distributed participation and flexibility that the strategy envisions, they must be designed and (more importantly) specified to expose the necessary interfaces and exhibit sufficient modularity to allow for future growth. This adoption of an open-systems architecture approach represents a potentially significant engineering investment that must be accounted for in acquisition processes, and be made a first-class citizen in planning and scheduling activities. We believe that in order for the U.S. Air Force (and the defense community in general) to truly realize the benefits that come with implementation of agile Capability Development as outlined in the strategy, program offices must: 1) Strive to gain deep, technical knowledge of the system modularity; 2) Specify the critical interfaces to a level of detail to allow capability developers to implement functionality in software; 3) Be able to act as a system integrator to verify and validate that potential component implementations can interoperate successfully within the overall system to accomplish the desired mission. In this paper, we outline a systems engineering approach using a dynamic, executable Model-Based Engineering methodology that we believe can help the government create the systems engineering environment required to implement agile capability development and finally reap its benefits.

We contribute a vision for discovery of new steps in adaptive workflow systems, suitability functions that can discover candidate alternatives, and a way forward for sourcing options for decision-makers, without the strong assumptions required by previous work. As data-processing workflows are shared, the sharing entities may find that certain parts of the workflow must be adapted to the new environment of mission. Extremely dynamic environments call for capabilities that support agile operations and pipeline sharing by making it possible to choose relevant actions when a situation invalidates the assumptions of current execution. We adapt some work in schema matching towards this problem, citing key differences between the two sets of challenges.

These tasks are created as refinements of product backlog items at the beginning of each sprint. However, a project team's understanding of the backlog items' business implications and dependencies may often not be deep enough to identify all necessary tasks this early, so in addition to the tasks defined in the beginning of the sprint, more necessary tasks might be discovered as the sprint progresses, making any attempt at progress estimation or risk management difficult. Objective We strive to enable software teams to achieve a deeper understanding of product backlog items, which should help them to identify a sprint's tasks more reliably and comprehensively, and avoid discovering the need for extra tasks during sprint execution. Method We introduced a project team in a medium-sized software development company to the Interaction Room method, which encourages interdisciplinary communication about key system design aspects among all stakeholders. We observed the team's conduct in the sprint planning meetings, and tracked early- vs. late-identified tasks across several sprints. Results Before the introduction of our method, the team used to discover on average 26% of a sprint's tasks not at the beginning of the sprint, but later during the course of the sprint. Using the Interaction Room in two separate projects, this ratio dropped to an average of 5% late-discovered tasks. Conclusion Our observations from these projects suggest that increased communication among all stakeholders of a project leads to a more reliable identification of the tasks to be performed in a sprint, and that an Interaction Room can provide appropriate guidance to conduct this team communication in a focused and pragmatic way.

Total Quality Management (TQM) provides several quality oriented tools and techniques which, in the event of things, are not always applicable. The increased use of Information Technology (IT) in manufacturing means increased data availability and improved potential for knowledge extraction. Exploiting this knowledge requires data storage and processing facilities with demanding, time consuming sessions for interpretation. Without suitable tools and techniques, knowledge remains hidden in databases. This paper presents a method to help identify root causes of nonconformities (NCs) using a pattern identification approach. Hereby, a general framework, Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), is adapted. This adaptation involves incorporating an economic concentration measure, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), as the data mining algorithm. After presenting the theoretical background, a new methodology is proposed. The suggested approach can be regarded as a quality tool to help make root cause identification of failures simpler and more agile. A case study from the automotive industry is examined using this tool. Results are obtained and presented in the form of matrix based patterns. They suggest that concentration indices help indicate possible root causes of NCs, warranting further investigation in this area.

The study showed that a mere 3.2% of all papers published during this period had any relationship to one of the key technological phenomena in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The paper formulates the hypothesis that the relative shift in impact between European- and US-based journals within the 'basket of 8' could have been influenced by editorial strategising to further encourage academic agility exploring new horizons rather than emphasis on further exploitation of existing ground. The paper, further argues that the \\{IS\\} field seems to more readily engage in a debate of phenomena involving centralised and organisationally-bound technological innovations whereas distributed, decentralised and infrastructural discourses find it much more difficult to gain a foothold. So, whilst the \\{IS\\} field may still be stuck in the mainframe age, it needs to move beyond in order to fully engage with the world we live in.

Methods Ethnographic investigation using the rapid assessment process, a procedure for agile qualitative data collection and analysis, including clinical observation, system demonstrations and analysis and 91 interviews. Results We identified challenges and lessons learned in eight dimensions: (1) hardware and software computing infrastructure, (2) clinical content, (3) human-computer interface, (4) people, (5) workflow and communication, (6) internal organizational policies, procedures, environment and culture, (7) external rules, regulations, and pressures and (8) system measurement and monitoring. Key challenges included performance issues (particularly related to data retrieval), differences in terminologies used across sites, workflow variability and the need for a legal framework. Discussion Based on the challenges and lessons learned, we identified eight best practices for developers and implementers of service-oriented clinical decision support: (1) optimize performance, or make asynchronous calls, (2) be liberal in what you accept (particularly for terminology), (3) foster clinical transparency, (4) develop a legal framework, (5) support a flexible front-end, (6) dedicate human resources, (7) support peer-to-peer communication, (8) improve standards. Conclusion The Clinical Decision Support Consortium successfully developed a clinical decision support service and implemented it in four different electronic health records and four diverse clinical sites; however, the process was arduous. The lessons identified by the Consortium may be useful for other developers and implementers of clinical decision support services.

This not only holds for processes running within a single enterprise, but also for collaborative scenarios involving distributed and autonomous partners. In particular, if one partner adapts its private process, the change might affect the processes of the other partners as well. Accordingly, it might have to be propagated to concerned partners in a transitive way. A fundamental challenge in this context is to find ways of propagating the changes in a decentralized manner. Existing approaches are limited with respect to the change operations considered as well as their dependency on a particular process specification language. This paper presents a generic change propagation approach that is based on the Refined Process Structure Tree, i.e., the approach is independent of a specific process specification language. Further, it considers a comprehensive set of change patterns. For all these change patterns, it is shown that the provided change propagation algorithms preserve consistency and compatibility of the process choreography. Finally, a proof-of-concept prototype of a change propagation framework for process choreographies is presented. Overall, comprehensive change support in process choreographies will foster the implementation and operational support of agile collaborative process scenarios.

Today, unfortunately, this capability does not exist. Why? Because most suppliers use proprietary information models to represent and share their \\{MSC\\} information! This limits both the semantic precision in the models, which is needed for interoperability, and the level of agility in the supply chains. The availability of a semantically precise and rich reference \\{MSC\\} ontology could address both of these limitations. Based on our prior research, the development of such an ontology will require a semantic mediation process between the proprietary \\{MSC\\} models and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. At the heart of every known, semantic-mediation process is a mapping between a proprietary \\{MSC\\} model and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. Such a mapping must deal with the structural and semantic conflicts between the two. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call canonicalization to address the structural conflicts. The semantic conflicts are addressed using logical mapping. The canonicalization pre-processes the structural representations of the proprietary models and then aligns them using ontology design patterns which are also used in the reference ontology. This simplifies both the mapping problems themselves and the resulting mapping statements considerably. In the paper, we also demonstrate our approach and its benefits in the context of a description-logic-based semantic mediation using the Ontology Web Language (OWL).

In addition to valued input from several vendors, commentary was provided from experienced pharmaceutical representatives, who have installed various continuous platforms. Additionally, a small medium enterprise (SME) perspective was obtained through interviews. A range of technical challenges is outlined, including: the presence of particles, equipment scalability, fouling (and cleaning), technology derisking, specific analytical challenges, and the general requirement of improved technical training. Equipment and analytical companies can make a significant contribution to help the introduction of continuous technology. A key point is that many of these challenges exist in batch processing and are not specific to continuous processing. Backward compatibility of software is not a continuous issue per se. In many cases, there is available learning from other industries. Business models and opportunities through outsourced development partners are also highlighted. Agile smaller companies and academic groups have a key role to play in developing skills, working collaboratively in partnerships, and focusing on solving relevant industry challenges. The precompetitive space differs for vendor companies compared with large pharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no strong consensus around a dominant continuous design, partly because of business dynamics and commercial interests. A more structured common approach to process design and hardware and software standardization would be beneficial, with initial practical steps in modeling. Conclusions include a digestible systems approach, accessible and published business cases, and increased user, academic, and supplier collaboration. This mirrors \\{US\\} \\{FDA\\} direction. The concept of silos in pharmaceutical companies is a common theme throughout the white papers. In the equipment domain, this is equally prevalent among a broad range of companies, mainly focusing on discrete areas. As an example, the flow chemistry and secondary drug product communities are almost entirely disconnected. Control and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT) companies are active in both domains. The equipment actors are a very diverse group with a few major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) players and a variety of SME, project providers, integrators, upstream downstream providers, and specialist PAT. In some cases, partnerships or alliances are formed to increase critical mass. This white paper has focused on small molecules; equipment associated with biopharmaceuticals is covered in a separate white paper. More specifics on equipment detail are provided in final dosage form and drug substance white papers. The equipment and analytical development from laboratory to pilot to production is important, with a variety of sensors and complexity reducing with scale. The importance of robust processing rather than overcomplex control strategy mitigation is important. A search of nonacademic literature highlights, with a few notable exceptions, a relative paucity of material. Much focuses on the economics and benefits of continuous, rather than specifics of equipment issues. The disruptive nature of continuous manufacturing represents either an opportunity or a threat for many companies, so the incentive to change equipment varies. Also, for many companies, the pharmaceutical sector is not actually the dominant sector in terms of sales. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.

Therefore, three concepts have been worked out to specify main requirements for an urban hybrid bike simulator. The first use case is from the perspective of a bicycle rental, where rental services for the users can be developed, validated, and optimized. The second use case provides the integration of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for the development and validation of mobile services for bicyclists. The third use case is oriented on development and validation of new bicycles and urban mobility concepts like e-bikes, pedelecs, tripelecs and sharing services.

Sustainable harvest of agaves and populations' recovery actions are needed for protecting this and other agave species similarly threatened. Our study aimed to identify mechanisms determining seedling establishment and sapling plants growth of A. potatorum in order to generate information helpful for enhancing populations' growing and reforestation strategies. We hypothesized that (1) A. potatorum plants are spatially associated, probably species-specific, to shrub species, the frequency of facilitation being higher in the earlier stages of life cycle, varying among sites under different stress conditions, (2) germination and seedling survival are higher beneath nurse plants canopy compared with open areas, seeds and plants from a particular site performing better in the original conditions than in others, (3) nurse plants have a positive effect in the net balance of the growth rate of A. potatorum despite the negative effects of shade on carbon gain. We studied the association of A. potatorum with shrub and tree species by analysing their distribution patterns in two sites with contrasting environments (one relatively more xeric than the other). In these site we conducted experiments for testing seedling establishment and growth of agaves. Reciprocal transplanting experiments tested seed germination and seedling survival of agaves in open areas and beneath nurse plants. Two-years-old saplings were planted in open areas and beneath nurse plants to analyse their relative growth rate. We found a significant association of both young and adult plants to nurse plants, some of them being markedly specific. Germination and survival were higher under nurse plants, we also found negative effects of shade in carbon gain, but growth was higher there than in open spaces. We suggest that protection against solar radiation is a main factor influencing the association. Provenance of seeds was significant for germination success and early establishment. Nurse plants are crucial for the establishment of A. potatorum; however, several species may play the role of nurse plants and these may be different among sites. Therefore, rapid identification of nurse plant species in different vegetation types would allow agile actions for successful reforestation. Manual dispersion of seeds beneath canopies of shrubs that are high quality nurse plants, as well as producing sapling agaves in nurseries and transplanting them after two years associated to nurse plants are recommendable techniques for populations' recovery.

The new machine was taken for a European test tour, so that it could be tested under conditions considered typical of Mediterranean, Alpine, Central and Nordic Europe. The same machine and operator were used for all tests, which lasted 65 h and produced over 100 chip containers. Productivity varied between 13 and 19 tonnes of green chips per scheduled hour, inclusive of all delays. Fuel consumption ranged from 1.8 to 2.8 dm3 of diesel per tonne of green chips. Machine utilization ranged from 68 to 89%, and it was highest in the Nordic trials, due to the use of pre-parked containers, which dramatically reduced the occurrence of interaction delays. Regional differences were only related to operational layout and organization, which set the Nordic trial apart from all others. Knife wear and screen size had a major impact on chipper performance. The same accounted for cut length. Production of small chips is only justified when the market offers premium prices for this assortment.

In this paper, a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)-based underlay \\{CC\\} design for distributed coordination in \\{CR\\} networks (CRNs) is proposed. The proposed design provides immunity to licensed primary radio (PR) interference (reliable communication), low transmission power (PR users' protection) and predefined-required transmission rate and range (network connectivity). The Proposed design ensures that both narrow-band data and wide-band control transmissions can be simultaneously proceeded while protecting the performance of \\{PR\\} users. To ensure reliable \\{CR\\} control communications, a closed-form expression is derived for the minimum required transmission power for control packet transmissions such that required transmission range and rate are achieved.

Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known of the actual metrics use in Agile teams. Objective The objective of this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the used metrics. Method This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process. Results The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning, progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate. Conclusion The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as they can offer the largest impact to the software industry.

Whereas software was once considered a detail to be bundled, it has since become an intricate and interdependent part of most products. The advancement of software increases the uncertainty and the interdependencies between development tasks and artifacts. A key success factor is good requirements engineering (RE), and in particular, the challenges of effectively and efficiently coordinating and communicating requirements. Objective In this work we present a lightweight \\{RE\\} framework and demonstrate and evaluate its industrial applicability in response to the needs of a Swedish automotive company for improving specific problems in inter-departmental requirements coordination and communication in large-scale development of software-intensive systems. Method A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews. Results The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and communicating requirements identified at the case company. However, other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and competences in the early development phases, were identified when using the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken. Conclusion Overall, the experience from using the framework and the positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems related to coordination and communication of requirements. Based on the promising results, our industrial partner has decided upon further validations of the framework in a large-scale pilot program.

This understanding can be used as a basis for guiding formation and maintenance of high-performing teams, to inform performance improvement initiatives, and to improve working conditions for software developers. Method A qualitative multiple-case study using thematic interviews was conducted with 16 experienced practitioners in five organisations. Results We generated a grounded theory, Performance Alignment Work, showing how software developers experience performance. We found 33 major categories of performance factors and relationships between the factors. A cross-case comparison revealed similarities and differences between different kinds and different sizes of organisations. Conclusions Based on our study, software teams are engaged in a constant cycle of interpreting their own performance and negotiating its alignment with other stakeholders. While differences across organisational sizes exist, a common set of performance experiences is present despite differences in context variables. Enhancing performance experiences requires integration of soft factors, such as communication, team spirit, team identity, and values, into the overall development process.

Hybrid development models, referred to as user-centered agile software development (UCASD) in this article, propose to combine the merits of both approaches in order to design software that is both useful and usable. Objective This paper aims to capture the current state of the art in \\{UCASD\\} approaches and to derive generic principles from these approaches. More specifically, we investigate the following research question: Which principles constitute a user-centered agile software development approach? Method We conduct a systematic review of the literature on UCASD. Identified works are analyzed using a coding scheme that differentiates four levels of UCASD: the process, practices, people/social and technology dimensions. Through subsequent synthesis, we derive generic principles of UCASD. Results We identified and analyzed 83 relevant publications. The analysis resulted in a comprehensive coding system and five principles for UCASD: (1) separate product discovery and product creation, (2) iterative and incremental design and development, (3) parallel interwoven creation tracks, (4) continuous stakeholder involvement, and (5) artifact-mediated communication.

Objective The present study aims to provide a deep insight into the current capabilities and future trends of software support for agile \\{RE\\} practices based on user stories. Method A comparative qualitative study of a set of agile software tools has been conducted according to the following criteria: coverage of the key functional requirements, support for basic agile \\{RE\\} concepts and practices, and user satisfaction with the tool. The criteria for tool selection were: diversity of software tools, high rating on the user-stories community Web site (http://www.userstories.com), and availability for review. Results The results show a generally good coverage of key functional requirements related to management of user stories and epics, high-level release planning and low-level iteration planning.

Among the findings are the followings: (1) The military and defense software sectors are quite prominent in Turkey, especially in the capital Ankara region, and many \\{SE\\} practitioners work for those companies. (2) 54% of the participants reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33% mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of effort, after the development phase (on average, 31% of overall project effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases come next and have similar average values (14%, 12%, 12% and 11% respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents (53%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38% and 34%, respectively. (6) The Waterfall and Agile methodologies have slight negative correlations, denoting that if one is used in a company, the other will less likely to be used. The results of our survey will be of interest to \\{SE\\} professionals both in Turkey and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in \\{SE\\} industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in those areas.

The research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of composing processes for three software development projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable sequence of components. Findings: The main findings indicate that \\{GA\\} is more effective (best results regarding the fitness function) than \\{HC\\} and \\{RS\\} in the search of solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a context. These \\{SBSE\\} results were complemented by the feedback given by specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity, adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager during the decision making in process composition. Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample prevents generalization for other types of projects or different contexts. Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition, since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile, and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase collaboration in software development. Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area. Finally, this work expands the body of knowledge in \\{SBSE\\} to the field of software process which has not been properly explored by former research.

Method: The method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches. These studies have been identified as case studies regarding the empirical research, as solution proposals regarding the research type, and as evaluation studies regarding the research validation type. Most of the papers used method engineering to implement tailoring and were not specific to any agile method on their scope. Conclusion: Most of agile methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables.

Inter-organisational agile projects possess unique attributes. They involve multiple stakeholders from different organisational contexts and are thus characterised by competing priorities. Team members also lack a mutual awareness of what constitutes work. These issues make the collaboration between project teams challenging. Meanwhile collaboration between usability designers and agile project teams is an integral part of the integration of usability activities into agile development projects. We carried out an interpretive case study on a large inter-organisational agile development project to examine how usability designers and agile project teams collaborate in this project type. Results showed integration goals were achieved through five tactics deployed by the usability designers. These tactics were negotiating inclusion; upward influencing, placating expert users, establishing credibility and diffusing designs. The implications of these findings are summarised in the form of three propositions that pertain to how usability designer-agile project team collaborations might be organised in agile development projects. Further, the role of the usability designer in ensuring the integration of usability activities is also emphasised.

In this research, the particular issue of compliance of Agile Software Development Methodologies (SCRUM, XP, and UPEDU) and the new ISO/IEC 29110 standard is studied. Because the new standard is focused on the software process in very small software development companies or small software project teams in the range from 1 to 25 people, and the Agile Software Development Methodologies (ASDMs) are primarily for same targets, this study is important.

Previous studies on release planning have focused on plan-driven optimization models. Unfortunately, solving the release planning problem mechanistically is difficult in an agile development context. Objective We describe how a release planning method was employed in two case projects in F-Secure, a large Finnish software company. We identify the benefits which the projects gained from the method, and analyze challenges in the cases and improvements made to the method during the case projects. Method We observed five release planning events and four retrospectives and we conducted surveys in the first two events. We conducted six post-project interviews. We conjoined the observation notes, survey results and interviews and analyzed them qualitatively and quantitatively. Results The focal point of the method was release planning events where the whole project organization gathered to plan the next release. The planning was conducted by the development teams in close collaboration with each other and with the other stakeholders. We identified ten benefits which included improved communication, transparency, dependency management and decision making. We identified nine challenges which included the lacking preparation and prioritization of requirements, unrealistic schedules, insufficient architectural planning and lacking agile mindset. The biggest improvements to the method were the introduction of frequent status checks and a big visible planning status board. Conclusion The release planning method ameliorated many difficult characteristics of the release planning problem but its efficiency was negatively affected by the performing organization that was in transition from a plan-driven to an agile development mindset. Even in this case the benefits clearly outweighed the challenges and the method enabled the early identification of the issues in the project.

This is challenging, especially for robots performing process-intensive tasks such as painting or gluing, since their dedicated process control systems can be loosely coupled with the robot's motion control. Objective Current practices for validating \\{CIRs\\} involve manual test case design and execution. To reduce testing costs and improve quality assurance, a trend is to automate the generation of test cases. Our work aims to define a cost-effective automated testing technique to validate \\{CIR\\} control systems in an industrial context. Method This paper reports on a methodology, developed at \\{ABB\\} Robotics in collaboration with SIMULA, for the fully automated testing of \\{CIRs\\} control systems. Our approach draws on continuous integration principles and well-established constraint-based testing techniques. It is based on a novel constraint-based model for automatically generating test sequences where test sequences are both generated and executed as part of a continuous integration process. Results By performing a detailed analysis of experimental results over a simplified version of our constraint model, we determine the most appropriate parameterization of the operational version of the constraint model. This version is now being deployed at \\{ABB\\} Robotics's \\{CIR\\} testing facilities and used on a permanent basis. This paper presents the empirical results obtained when automatically generating test sequences for \\{CIRs\\} at \\{ABB\\} Robotics. In a real industrial setting, the results show that our methodology is not only able to detect reintroduced known faults, but also to spot completely new faults. Conclusion Our empirical evaluation shows that constraint-based testing is appropriate for automatically generating test sequences for \\{CIRs\\} and can be faithfully deployed in an industrial context.

Requirements engineering and agile methods share common grounds as they both focus on stakeholder collaboration. The key issue is finding a way to study collaboration driven by requirements in geographically distributed agile teams. In this paper, we aim to propose a framework to study collaboration driven by requirements among agile teams and determine the impact of their collaboration patterns on the iteration performance. We define collaboration in terms of communication as information exchange among members, and awareness knowledge of others. Two case studies were conducted to examine communication and awareness network patterns among distributed agile teams. Data were collected through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and onsite observation. The findings revealed that the framework aids in determining the core members, collaboration trends, clustering tendency, communication and awareness reciprocity of the teams, small worldliness and centralisation behaviour of the networks and iteration performance of the agile teams. The framework has implications for the industrial practitioners, i.e. managers to learn about their team's collaboration in order to take measures for performance improvement. At the same time, the researchers can use this framework to study other social aspects in variable settings to produce more empirical results.

Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an \\{IT\\} phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

Organizations' ability to adapt to the fast changing conditions depending on the differing requirements of the customers, depend to a great extend on their ability to become agile. Since change and ambiguity always exist and always will in future, the necessity of the organizations to understand these changes in environment conditions quickly and to be able to respond gains importance every passing day. This requirement provides the wide spreading of agile manufacturing philosophy in organizations. Organizations, due to agile manufacturing, will be able to have the chance of turning the ambiguities in the environment to possibilities. Today, accessing correct and more detailed information became possible however another problem has arisen. This problem is the management of large numerical data stacks and their becoming meaningful. The work of turning raw data into information or making them meaningful can be made with data warehouse and business intelligence tools (data mining, inquiry-reporting, OLAP).

There is a need to model agile enterprise architecture artefacts both at the high and low detailed level for a particular context. ArchiMate is relatively a new high-level architecture modelling standard. There is a growing interest amongst organisations in applying ArchiMate for high-level agile enterprise architecture modelling. However, organisations are unsure how to effectively apply ArchiMate at high-level and integrate it with their existing low detailed level modelling standards in practice for supporting end-to-end agile enterprise architecture modelling. Objective This paper evaluates the applicability and integration of high-level ArchiMate modelling standard with the existing low-level modelling standards such as \\{BPMN\\} (Business Process Model and Notation), \\{UML\\} (Unified Modelling Language), \\{FAML\\} (FAME [Framework for Agent-Oriented Method Engineering] Language), SoaML (Service Oriented Architecture Modelling Language), and \\{BMM\\} (Business Motivation Model). Method A qualitative questionnaire-based evaluation criteria has been developed based on the well-known and comprehensive The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). The evaluation criteria has been applied to evaluate the applicability and integration of the selected six modelling standards from the business, application, infrastructure and extension perspectives. Results Each modelling standard is different in scope. A single modelling standard usually does not provide the kind of support required by the agile enterprise architecture modelling. Based on the review results, a hybrid enterprise architecture modelling approach is proposed. This paper demonstrates the application of the proposed hybrid approach with the help of an agile enterprise architecture modelling case study. Conclusion It is concluded that the ArchiMate does not replace the existing low-level modelling standards, rather it can be used in conjunction with low-level modelling standards. This calls for the adoption of hybrid and integrated approach for agile enterprise architecture modelling.

To facilitate agile development of information systems, this paper offers three contributions. First, we introduce the concept of evolvability as a model quality characteristic. Evolvability refers to the expected implications of future model refactorings, both in terms of complexity of the required database evolution algorithm and in terms of the expected volume of data to evolve. Second, we propose extending the agile development cycle by using database profiling information to suggest adaptations to the conceptual model to improve performance. For every software release, the database profiler identifies and analyses navigational access patterns, and proposes model optimisations based on data characteristics, access patterns and a cost-benefit model. Based on an experimental evaluation of the profiler we discuss why the quality of conceptual models can generally benefit from profiling and how performance measurements convey semantic information. Third, we discuss the flow of semantic information when developing and using information systems. Beyond these contributions, we also make a case for using object databases in agile development environments. However, most of the presented concepts are also applicable to other database paradigms.

Real estate development projects are no exception. However, reality frequently feed surprises into real estate development projects, creating needs for iterations, where the projects need to be re-defined. We also review agile methods used in IT-projects. The logic in these methods is iterative.This iterative aspect in IT-projects is relevant to real estate development projects as well. This means that real estate development projects have similarities with IT-projects, where the need for iterative development has contributed to the development of agile methods. We illustrate applications of the model, and corresponding time use in the development process. We find that there is significant variation in the time use, along with need for iterations.

More than a million cricketers play cricket daily in India alone and aspire to become professional cricketers. Cricket Talent identification and enhancement is a challenging problem due to lack of quality coaches, meagre infrastructural facilities, and poor linkages of coaching academies &amp; cricket authorities. In India, the problem is even tougher as the majority of the population resides in villages. Many of talented players do not get timely recognition of cricket boards' authorities thus amounting to waste of talent. Many keep on pursuing cricket despite of being non-talented. Due to lack of application of appropriate scientific methods the selection process is also criticized as biased by many. In this paper, we present a web based system viz. Cricket Talent Identification, Enhancement and Selection (C-TIES) for addressing the above issues. C-TIES utilize a cricket talent knowledgebase of experts' opinions aggregated by applying \\{OWA\\} Aggregation Operator and Relative Fuzzy Linguistic Quantifier (RFLQ). The C-TIES system classifies the cricket talent level of an enthusiast into five different classes by applying Normalized Adequacy Coefficient (NAC). The Talent Enhancement and Talent Selection subsystems also uses appropriate algorithms based on OWA, \\{RFLQ\\} and \\{NAC\\} to respectively enable identification of weaknesses in a player and select most talented n-players from a larger group of players. Thus, system reduces the time for identifying weaknesses and also provides a relatively better unbiased selection method for short listing players.

Existing planning methods all suggest that research and analysis should be the first phase, followed by strategy, smart goals and a detailed action plan, and ending with an evaluation of the results. These models provide an undesirable illusion of control. That is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders. Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant publics implicates. That is why preference should be given to the view that communication is not so much communication between two or more actors but is a multi-way diachronic process of ongoing constructions of meanings in which one cannot foresee who is - or will be - involved, in what way, and what the results will be. To be successful, a more flexible planning method is needed in which change is a defining part during the process. Scrum is such a method. To make it applicable in public relations, this agile method, well-known in IT, needed to be expanded by supplementing theory on communication, change and reflectivity, and by enrichment of the common notion of evaluation.

Research however has historically taken the perspective that stochastic demand is stationary therefore limiting its impact for practitioners. Manufacturers require schedules for multiple products that decide the quantity to be produced over a required time span. This work investigated the challenges for production in the framework of a single manufacturing line with multiple products and varying demand. The nature of varying demand of numerous products lends itself naturally to an agile manufacturing approach. We propose a new algorithm that iteratively refines production windows and adds products. This algorithm controls parallel genetic algorithms (pGA) that find production schedules while minimizing costs. The configuration of such a pGA was essential in influencing the quality of results. In particular providing initial solutions was an important factor. Two novel methods are proposed that generate initial solutions by transforming a production schedule into one with refined production windows. The first method is called factorial generation and the second one fractional generation method. A case study compares the two methods and shows that the factorial method outperforms the fractional one in terms of costs.

The strategy recognizes that traditional DoD methods of requirements development, acquisition oversight, and especially systems engineering are inadequate to produce results in the desired timeframe, in a manner that is receptive to more frequent decision points and opportunities to change direction. In order for these types of systems to evolve and support the type of distributed participation and flexibility that the strategy envisions, they must be designed and (more importantly) specified to expose the necessary interfaces and exhibit sufficient modularity to allow for future growth. This adoption of an open-systems architecture approach represents a potentially significant engineering investment that must be accounted for in acquisition processes, and be made a first-class citizen in planning and scheduling activities. We believe that in order for the U.S. Air Force (and the defense community in general) to truly realize the benefits that come with implementation of agile Capability Development as outlined in the strategy, program offices must: 1) Strive to gain deep, technical knowledge of the system modularity; 2) Specify the critical interfaces to a level of detail to allow capability developers to implement functionality in software; 3) Be able to act as a system integrator to verify and validate that potential component implementations can interoperate successfully within the overall system to accomplish the desired mission.

For many government and business missions, these systems are used to manage repetitive processes, such as large data-processing and exploitation pipelines. Government missions with strong interactions with the real world are extremely dynamic, as are all missions dealing with error-prone or changing data streams. We contribute a vision for discovery of new steps in adaptive workflow systems, suitability functions that can discover candidate alternatives, and a way forward for sourcing options for decision-makers, without the strong assumptions required by previous work. As data-processing workflows are shared, the sharing entities may find that certain parts of the workflow must be adapted to the new environment of mission.

These tasks are created as refinements of product backlog items at the beginning of each sprint. However, a project team's understanding of the backlog items' business implications and dependencies may often not be deep enough to identify all necessary tasks this early, so in addition to the tasks defined in the beginning of the sprint, more necessary tasks might be discovered as the sprint progresses, making any attempt at progress estimation or risk management difficult. Objective We strive to enable software teams to achieve a deeper understanding of product backlog items, which should help them to identify a sprint's tasks more reliably and comprehensively, and avoid discovering the need for extra tasks during sprint execution. Method We introduced a project team in a medium-sized software development company to the Interaction Room method, which encourages interdisciplinary communication about key system design aspects among all stakeholders. We observed the team's conduct in the sprint planning meetings, and tracked early- vs. late-identified tasks across several sprints. Results Before the introduction of our method, the team used to discover on average 26% of a sprint's tasks not at the beginning of the sprint, but later during the course of the sprint. Using the Interaction Room in two separate projects, this ratio dropped to an average of 5% late-discovered tasks. Conclusion Our observations from these projects suggest that increased communication among all stakeholders of a project leads to a more reliable identification of the tasks to be performed in a sprint, and that an Interaction Room can provide appropriate guidance to conduct this team communication in a focused and pragmatic way.

Total Quality Management (TQM) provides several quality oriented tools and techniques which, in the event of things, are not always applicable. The increased use of Information Technology (IT) in manufacturing means increased data availability and improved potential for knowledge extraction. Exploiting this knowledge requires data storage and processing facilities with demanding, time consuming sessions for interpretation. Without suitable tools and techniques, knowledge remains hidden in databases. This paper presents a method to help identify root causes of nonconformities (NCs) using a pattern identification approach. Hereby, a general framework, Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), is adapted. This adaptation involves incorporating an economic concentration measure, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), as the data mining algorithm. After presenting the theoretical background, a new methodology is proposed. The suggested approach can be regarded as a quality tool to help make root cause identification of failures simpler and more agile. A case study from the automotive industry is examined using this tool. Results are obtained and presented in the form of matrix based patterns. They suggest that concentration indices help indicate possible root causes of NCs, warranting further investigation in this area.

Results We identified challenges and lessons learned in eight dimensions: (1) hardware and software computing infrastructure, (2) clinical content, (3) human-computer interface, (4) people, (5) workflow and communication, (6) internal organizational policies, procedures, environment and culture, (7) external rules, regulations, and pressures and (8) system measurement and monitoring. Key challenges included performance issues (particularly related to data retrieval), differences in terminologies used across sites, workflow variability and the need for a legal framework. Discussion Based on the challenges and lessons learned, we identified eight best practices for developers and implementers of service-oriented clinical decision support: (1) optimize performance, or make asynchronous calls, (2) be liberal in what you accept (particularly for terminology), (3) foster clinical transparency, (4) develop a legal framework, (5) support a flexible front-end, (6) dedicate human resources, (7) support peer-to-peer communication, (8) improve standards.

This not only holds for processes running within a single enterprise, but also for collaborative scenarios involving distributed and autonomous partners. In particular, if one partner adapts its private process, the change might affect the processes of the other partners as well. Accordingly, it might have to be propagated to concerned partners in a transitive way. A fundamental challenge in this context is to find ways of propagating the changes in a decentralized manner. Existing approaches are limited with respect to the change operations considered as well as their dependency on a particular process specification language. This paper presents a generic change propagation approach that is based on the Refined Process Structure Tree, i.e., the approach is independent of a specific process specification language. Further, it considers a comprehensive set of change patterns. For all these change patterns, it is shown that the provided change propagation algorithms preserve consistency and compatibility of the process choreography. Finally, a proof-of-concept prototype of a change propagation framework for process choreographies is presented. Overall, comprehensive change support in process choreographies will foster the implementation and operational support of agile collaborative process scenarios.

Knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD), aka data science, is a method developed in the private sector to mine consumer data and can be used in public settings to support evidence based governance. \\{KDD\\} consists of a rigorous 5-step process that includes a Web-based end-user interface. The relationship between \\{KDD\\} and governance is a continuous feedback cycle that enables ongoing development of new information and knowledge as stakeholders identify emerging needs. In this paper, we synthesis the different frameworks for utilizing big data for public governance, introduce the \\{KDD\\} process, describe the nature of big data in child welfare, and then present an updated \\{KDD\\} architecture that can support these frameworks to utilize big data for governance. We also demonstrate the role \\{KDD\\} plays in child welfare management through 2 case studies. We conclude with a discussion on implications for agency-university partnerships and research-to-practice.

Today, unfortunately, this capability does not exist. Why? Because most suppliers use proprietary information models to represent and share their \\{MSC\\} information! This limits both the semantic precision in the models, which is needed for interoperability, and the level of agility in the supply chains. The availability of a semantically precise and rich reference \\{MSC\\} ontology could address both of these limitations. Based on our prior research, the development of such an ontology will require a semantic mediation process between the proprietary \\{MSC\\} models and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. At the heart of every known, semantic-mediation process is a mapping between a proprietary \\{MSC\\} model and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. Such a mapping must deal with the structural and semantic conflicts between the two. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call canonicalization to address the structural conflicts. The semantic conflicts are addressed using logical mapping. The canonicalization pre-processes the structural representations of the proprietary models and then aligns them using ontology design patterns which are also used in the reference ontology. This simplifies both the mapping problems themselves and the resulting mapping statements considerably. In the paper, we also demonstrate our approach and its benefits in the context of a description-logic-based semantic mediation using the Ontology Web Language (OWL).

In addition to valued input from several vendors, commentary was provided from experienced pharmaceutical representatives, who have installed various continuous platforms. Additionally, a small medium enterprise (SME) perspective was obtained through interviews. A range of technical challenges is outlined, including: the presence of particles, equipment scalability, fouling (and cleaning), technology derisking, specific analytical challenges, and the general requirement of improved technical training. Equipment and analytical companies can make a significant contribution to help the introduction of continuous technology. A key point is that many of these challenges exist in batch processing and are not specific to continuous processing. Backward compatibility of software is not a continuous issue per se. In many cases, there is available learning from other industries. Business models and opportunities through outsourced development partners are also highlighted. Agile smaller companies and academic groups have a key role to play in developing skills, working collaboratively in partnerships, and focusing on solving relevant industry challenges. The precompetitive space differs for vendor companies compared with large pharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no strong consensus around a dominant continuous design, partly because of business dynamics and commercial interests. A more structured common approach to process design and hardware and software standardization would be beneficial, with initial practical steps in modeling. Conclusions include a digestible systems approach, accessible and published business cases, and increased user, academic, and supplier collaboration. This mirrors \\{US\\} \\{FDA\\} direction. The concept of silos in pharmaceutical companies is a common theme throughout the white papers. In the equipment domain, this is equally prevalent among a broad range of companies, mainly focusing on discrete areas. As an example, the flow chemistry and secondary drug product communities are almost entirely disconnected. Control and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT) companies are active in both domains. The equipment actors are a very diverse group with a few major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) players and a variety of SME, project providers, integrators, upstream downstream providers, and specialist PAT. In some cases, partnerships or alliances are formed to increase critical mass. This white paper has focused on small molecules; equipment associated with biopharmaceuticals is covered in a separate white paper. More specifics on equipment detail are provided in final dosage form and drug substance white papers. The equipment and analytical development from laboratory to pilot to production is important, with a variety of sensors and complexity reducing with scale. The importance of robust processing rather than overcomplex control strategy mitigation is important. A search of nonacademic literature highlights, with a few notable exceptions, a relative paucity of material. Much focuses on the economics and benefits of continuous, rather than specifics of equipment issues. The disruptive nature of continuous manufacturing represents either an opportunity or a threat for many companies, so the incentive to change equipment varies. Also, for many companies, the pharmaceutical sector is not actually the dominant sector in terms of sales. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.

This research includes an \\{EU\\} funded 3 year project HoliDes - Holistic Human Factors and System Design of Adaptive Cooperative Human Machine Systems. Continuous engineering within Airbus has included various corporate and divisional Synergy programs and lean and agile initiatives. As our business is defined by Multiple Portfolio products, supplied from multi countries, the \\{MBSE\\} process had to speed up delivery and reduce overall cost. The Airbus process models needed significant amendment due to products supplied via multiple business lines throughout the company. This problem is exacerbated by varying requirements of four national defence requirements, who impose restrictions on the use of Architectural Frameworks (NAF/MODAF/DODAF) and supporting tools. Our Human System Integration (HSI) is continuing from the initial Human View Architectural Framework research to include the nine \\{HSI\\} domains. These nine domains overlap with our current Human factors research and will now allow us to pull in our Non-functional work into our Systems Engineering lifecycle. This paper highlights the research projects Airbus Space and Defence are incorporating in to our overall strategy, these include internal R&amp;D funding and European Union funded research programs. These research projects have highlighted several areas of interest these include, stochastic modelling with respect to Human System Integration and Human views, verification and analysis of emergent behaviour and non-functional properties, which conforms with our own work on non-functional requirements and finally the use of System of System Formal Methods for parts of the lifecycle.

It is based upon methods of Mixed Reality extended by modern industrial technologies to allow natural interaction with virtual prototypes of mechanical or mechatronic systems. It serves as a bridge between physical reality and digital virtuality. The use cases in this paper are based on urban bike mobility. Therefore, three concepts have been worked out to specify main requirements for an urban hybrid bike simulator. The first use case is from the perspective of a bicycle rental, where rental services for the users can be developed, validated, and optimized. The second use case provides the integration of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for the development and validation of mobile services for bicyclists. The third use case is oriented on development and validation of new bicycles and urban mobility concepts like e-bikes, pedelecs, tripelecs and sharing services. Based on these generic use cases the requirements on a hybrid bicycle simulator were derived. Why a bicycle simulator? Well, we are firmly convinced that the future of urban mobility is determined from trends such as ecological rethinking and the desire for sports and healthy life. Furthermore, it is one of the most competitive and agile markets using most innovative materials and manufacturing technologies.

Sustainable harvest of agaves and populations' recovery actions are needed for protecting this and other agave species similarly threatened. Our study aimed to identify mechanisms determining seedling establishment and sapling plants growth of A. potatorum in order to generate information helpful for enhancing populations' growing and reforestation strategies. We hypothesized that (1) A. potatorum plants are spatially associated, probably species-specific, to shrub species, the frequency of facilitation being higher in the earlier stages of life cycle, varying among sites under different stress conditions, (2) germination and seedling survival are higher beneath nurse plants canopy compared with open areas, seeds and plants from a particular site performing better in the original conditions than in others, (3) nurse plants have a positive effect in the net balance of the growth rate of A. potatorum despite the negative effects of shade on carbon gain. We studied the association of A. potatorum with shrub and tree species by analysing their distribution patterns in two sites with contrasting environments (one relatively more xeric than the other). In these site we conducted experiments for testing seedling establishment and growth of agaves. Reciprocal transplanting experiments tested seed germination and seedling survival of agaves in open areas and beneath nurse plants. Two-years-old saplings were planted in open areas and beneath nurse plants to analyse their relative growth rate. We found a significant association of both young and adult plants to nurse plants, some of them being markedly specific. Germination and survival were higher under nurse plants, we also found negative effects of shade in carbon gain, but growth was higher there than in open spaces. We suggest that protection against solar radiation is a main factor influencing the association. Provenance of seeds was significant for germination success and early establishment. Nurse plants are crucial for the establishment of A. potatorum; however, several species may play the role of nurse plants and these may be different among sites. Therefore, rapid identification of nurse plant species in different vegetation types would allow agile actions for successful reforestation. Manual dispersion of seeds beneath canopies of shrubs that are high quality nurse plants, as well as producing sapling agaves in nurseries and transplanting them after two years associated to nurse plants are recommendable techniques for populations' recovery.

Regional differences were only related to operational layout and organization, which set the Nordic trial apart from all others. Knife wear and screen size had a major impact on chipper performance. The same accounted for cut length. Production of small chips is only justified when the market offers premium prices for this assortment.

Method This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process.

Method A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews. Results The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and communicating requirements identified at the case company. However, other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and competences in the early development phases, were identified when using the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken. Conclusion Overall, the experience from using the framework and the positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems related to coordination and communication of requirements. Based on the promising results, our industrial partner has decided upon further validations of the framework in a large-scale pilot program.

Consequently, a great number of software tools that provide, inter alia, support for practices based on user stories have emerged in recent years. These tools may have different features and focus in terms of support for agile requirements engineering (RE) concepts and practices. Objective The present study aims to provide a deep insight into the current capabilities and future trends of software support for agile \\{RE\\} practices based on user stories. Method A comparative qualitative study of a set of agile software tools has been conducted according to the following criteria: coverage of the key functional requirements, support for basic agile \\{RE\\} concepts and practices, and user satisfaction with the tool. The criteria for tool selection were: diversity of software tools, high rating on the user-stories community Web site (http://www.userstories.com), and availability for review. Results The results show a generally good coverage of key functional requirements related to management of user stories and epics, high-level release planning and low-level iteration planning. On the other hand, user-role modeling and persona support have not been addressed at all, and it has been found that requirements for acceptance testing support were completely covered by only one tool. More importantly, the study has revealed significant differences in the way different tools support agile \\{RE\\} concepts and practices (if at all). Finally, qualitative analysis of user reviews has demonstrated that practitioners prefer tools that are easy to set up, easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to customize, over more sophisticated but simultaneously more demanding tools.

For this, different techniques like expert opinion, analogy, disaggregation etc. are adopted by researchers and practitioners. But no proper mathematical model exists for this. The existing techniques are ad-hoc and are thus prone to be incorrect. One popular approach of calculating effort of agile projects mathematically is the Story Point Approach (SPA).

Software quality has been an important topic since the beginning of the software development and production. Many researches have been conducted to discuss how the quality of software is a critical factor to its success [1-5]. Because software became an important part of almost every task in our daily life, having high quality software that meets the users' expectations is important [6]. Software integration is a stage in every software development lifecycle, it is defined as the process to assemble the software components and produce a single product. It has been shown that software integration and integration testing can make more than 40% of the overall project cost, so it is important that they are done efficiently and easily to be able to manage the involved risks [7]. A software engineering practice called continuous integration (CI) was introduced by Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries to mitigate the risks of software integration, enhance its process and improve its quality [8]. In this research, the principles of \\{CI\\} are identified and applied to a case study in order to analyze their impact on the software development process quality factors.

Although the value of the agile methodologies is well proven for small, collocated teams, the research question that this work is addressing refers to the benefits of the agile methodologies on large, distributed projects. With this paper, evidence is provided by the analysis of a case study that agile software development methodologies perform better than traditional methodologies also in large, distributed projects. Improvements are observed on the quality and on the customer perception of the end product, while agile methodologies allow for requirement changes even late in the project. At the same time, building better communication and collaboration in the team as an outcome of following the agile practices, results to enhanced relations between team members and to improved employee satisfaction metrics.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of \\{SE\\} practices conducted in industry. Turkey has a vibrant software industry and it is important to characterize and understand the state of its \\{SE\\} practices. Our objective is to characterize and grasp a high-level view on type of \\{SE\\} practices in the Turkish software industry. To achieve this objective, we systematically designed an online survey with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian and Turkish contexts and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Two hundred and two practicing software engineers from the Turkish software industry participated in the survey. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about \\{SE\\} practices in Turkey and beyond. They also help track the profession of SE, and suggest areas for improved training, education and research. Among the findings are the followings: (1) The military and defense software sectors are quite prominent in Turkey, especially in the capital Ankara region, and many \\{SE\\} practitioners work for those companies. (2) 54% of the participants reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33% mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of effort, after the development phase (on average, 31% of overall project effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases come next and have similar average values (14%, 12%, 12% and 11% respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents (53%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38% and 34%, respectively. (6) The Waterfall and Agile methodologies have slight negative correlations, denoting that if one is used in a company, the other will less likely to be used. The results of our survey will be of interest to \\{SE\\} professionals both in Turkey and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in \\{SE\\} industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in those areas.

The research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of composing processes for three software development projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable sequence of components. Findings: The main findings indicate that \\{GA\\} is more effective (best results regarding the fitness function) than \\{HC\\} and \\{RS\\} in the search of solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a context. These \\{SBSE\\} results were complemented by the feedback given by specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity, adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager during the decision making in process composition. Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample prevents generalization for other types of projects or different contexts. Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition, since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile, and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase collaboration in software development. Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area. Finally, this work expands the body of knowledge in \\{SBSE\\} to the field of software process which has not been properly explored by former research.

Inter-organisational agile projects possess unique attributes. They involve multiple stakeholders from different organisational contexts and are thus characterised by competing priorities. Team members also lack a mutual awareness of what constitutes work. These issues make the collaboration between project teams challenging. Meanwhile collaboration between usability designers and agile project teams is an integral part of the integration of usability activities into agile development projects. We carried out an interpretive case study on a large inter-organisational agile development project to examine how usability designers and agile project teams collaborate in this project type. Results showed integration goals were achieved through five tactics deployed by the usability designers. These tactics were negotiating inclusion; upward influencing, placating expert users, establishing credibility and diffusing designs. The implications of these findings are summarised in the form of three propositions that pertain to how usability designer-agile project team collaborations might be organised in agile development projects. Further, the role of the usability designer in ensuring the integration of usability activities is also emphasised.

Objective This paper addresses the importance of adequate and functional training in Agile transformation process, the causes of inadequate and dysfunctional training, and the heuristic strategies that can be used in software companies for dealing with this phenomenon. Method A Grounded Theory study was conducted with participation of 35 Agile experts from 13 different countries. Results This research discovered that inadequate and dysfunctional training was one of the critical issues that affected Agile transformation process. This study shows that comprehensive and functional training is not often provided to support Agile transformation. This paper shows the primary causes of inadequate and dysfunctional training, its adverse consequences on the transformation process, and the heuristic and ad-hoc treatments as the strategies used by Agile teams to cope with this challenge. Conclusion Comprehensive training is important in Agile transformation process. Inadequate and dysfunctional training causes several challenges and problems for software companies and development teams when moving to Agile. Several ad-hoc strategies identified by this study can be employed to help software teams and companies facing similar problems.

Objective This paper aims at creating a comprehensive set of risk factors that affect the performance of distributed agile development projects and identifies the risk management methods which are frequently used in practice for controlling those risks. Method The study is an exploration of practitioners' experience using constant comparison method for analyzing in-depth interviews of thirteen practitioners and work documents of twenty-eight projects from thirteen different information technology (IT) organizations. The field experience was supported by extensive research literature on risk management in traditional, agile and distributed development.

However, they do not prescribe a particular software development methodology (i.e. RUP, MSF), and thus software development teams face a compliance problem between the selected development methodology and a pursued particular standard or model. In this research, the particular issue of compliance of Agile Software Development Methodologies (SCRUM, XP, and UPEDU) and the new ISO/IEC 29110 standard is studied. Because the new standard is focused on the software process in very small software development companies or small software project teams in the range from 1 to 25 people, and the Agile Software Development Methodologies (ASDMs) are primarily for same targets, this study is important.

Previous studies on release planning have focused on plan-driven optimization models. Unfortunately, solving the release planning problem mechanistically is difficult in an agile development context. Objective We describe how a release planning method was employed in two case projects in F-Secure, a large Finnish software company. We identify the benefits which the projects gained from the method, and analyze challenges in the cases and improvements made to the method during the case projects. Method We observed five release planning events and four retrospectives and we conducted surveys in the first two events. We conducted six post-project interviews. We conjoined the observation notes, survey results and interviews and analyzed them qualitatively and quantitatively. Results The focal point of the method was release planning events where the whole project organization gathered to plan the next release. The planning was conducted by the development teams in close collaboration with each other and with the other stakeholders. We identified ten benefits which included improved communication, transparency, dependency management and decision making. We identified nine challenges which included the lacking preparation and prioritization of requirements, unrealistic schedules, insufficient architectural planning and lacking agile mindset. The biggest improvements to the method were the introduction of frequent status checks and a big visible planning status board. Conclusion The release planning method ameliorated many difficult characteristics of the release planning problem but its efficiency was negatively affected by the performing organization that was in transition from a plan-driven to an agile development mindset. Even in this case the benefits clearly outweighed the challenges and the method enabled the early identification of the issues in the project.

Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an \\{IT\\} phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

There is a need to model agile enterprise architecture artefacts both at the high and low detailed level for a particular context. ArchiMate is relatively a new high-level architecture modelling standard. There is a growing interest amongst organisations in applying ArchiMate for high-level agile enterprise architecture modelling. However, organisations are unsure how to effectively apply ArchiMate at high-level and integrate it with their existing low detailed level modelling standards in practice for supporting end-to-end agile enterprise architecture modelling. Objective This paper evaluates the applicability and integration of high-level ArchiMate modelling standard with the existing low-level modelling standards such as \\{BPMN\\} (Business Process Model and Notation), \\{UML\\} (Unified Modelling Language), \\{FAML\\} (FAME [Framework for Agent-Oriented Method Engineering] Language), SoaML (Service Oriented Architecture Modelling Language), and \\{BMM\\} (Business Motivation Model). Method A qualitative questionnaire-based evaluation criteria has been developed based on the well-known and comprehensive The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). The evaluation criteria has been applied to evaluate the applicability and integration of the selected six modelling standards from the business, application, infrastructure and extension perspectives. Results Each modelling standard is different in scope. A single modelling standard usually does not provide the kind of support required by the agile enterprise architecture modelling. Based on the review results, a hybrid enterprise architecture modelling approach is proposed. This paper demonstrates the application of the proposed hybrid approach with the help of an agile enterprise architecture modelling case study. Conclusion It is concluded that the ArchiMate does not replace the existing low-level modelling standards, rather it can be used in conjunction with low-level modelling standards. This calls for the adoption of hybrid and integrated approach for agile enterprise architecture modelling.

To facilitate agile development of information systems, this paper offers three contributions. First, we introduce the concept of evolvability as a model quality characteristic. Evolvability refers to the expected implications of future model refactorings, both in terms of complexity of the required database evolution algorithm and in terms of the expected volume of data to evolve. Second, we propose extending the agile development cycle by using database profiling information to suggest adaptations to the conceptual model to improve performance. For every software release, the database profiler identifies and analyses navigational access patterns, and proposes model optimisations based on data characteristics, access patterns and a cost-benefit model. Based on an experimental evaluation of the profiler we discuss why the quality of conceptual models can generally benefit from profiling and how performance measurements convey semantic information. Third, we discuss the flow of semantic information when developing and using information systems. Beyond these contributions, we also make a case for using object databases in agile development environments. However, most of the presented concepts are also applicable to other database paradigms.

We specifically concentrate on radar and underwater acoustic signal transmission environments. As we consider systems with potentially large number of sensors, we discuss the use of resource-agile implementation approaches based on multiple-core processors in order to efficiently implement the computationally intensive processing in configuring the sensors. These resource-agile approaches can be extended to also optimize sensing in distributed sensor networks.

We review real estate development models and project management. Project models typically describe a project process as a linear development, from idea, through decisions, execution and delivery. Real estate development projects are no exception. However, reality frequently feed surprises into real estate development projects, creating needs for iterations, where the projects need to be re-defined. We also review agile methods used in IT-projects. The logic in these methods is iterative.This iterative aspect in IT-projects is relevant to real estate development projects as well. This means that real estate development projects have similarities with IT-projects, where the need for iterative development has contributed to the development of agile methods. We illustrate applications of the model, and corresponding time use in the development process. We find that there is significant variation in the time use, along with need for iterations. The time needed for processing a regulation plan in Norway is found to be minimum about one year, but it may take two years or more.

More than a million cricketers play cricket daily in India alone and aspire to become professional cricketers. Cricket Talent identification and enhancement is a challenging problem due to lack of quality coaches, meagre infrastructural facilities, and poor linkages of coaching academies &amp; cricket authorities. In India, the problem is even tougher as the majority of the population resides in villages. Many of talented players do not get timely recognition of cricket boards' authorities thus amounting to waste of talent. Many keep on pursuing cricket despite of being non-talented. Due to lack of application of appropriate scientific methods the selection process is also criticized as biased by many. In this paper, we present a web based system viz. Cricket Talent Identification, Enhancement and Selection (C-TIES) for addressing the above issues. C-TIES utilize a cricket talent knowledgebase of experts' opinions aggregated by applying \\{OWA\\} Aggregation Operator and Relative Fuzzy Linguistic Quantifier (RFLQ). The C-TIES system classifies the cricket talent level of an enthusiast into five different classes by applying Normalized Adequacy Coefficient (NAC).

Existing planning methods all suggest that research and analysis should be the first phase, followed by strategy, smart goals and a detailed action plan, and ending with an evaluation of the results. These models provide an undesirable illusion of control. That is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders. Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant publics implicates. That is why preference should be given to the view that communication is not so much communication between two or more actors but is a multi-way diachronic process of ongoing constructions of meanings in which one cannot foresee who is - or will be - involved, in what way, and what the results will be. To be successful, a more flexible planning method is needed in which change is a defining part during the process. Scrum is such a method. To make it applicable in public relations, this agile method, well-known in IT, needed to be expanded by supplementing theory on communication, change and reflectivity, and by enrichment of the common notion of evaluation.

Research however has historically taken the perspective that stochastic demand is stationary therefore limiting its impact for practitioners. Manufacturers require schedules for multiple products that decide the quantity to be produced over a required time span. This work investigated the challenges for production in the framework of a single manufacturing line with multiple products and varying demand. The nature of varying demand of numerous products lends itself naturally to an agile manufacturing approach. We propose a new algorithm that iteratively refines production windows and adds products. This algorithm controls parallel genetic algorithms (pGA) that find production schedules while minimizing costs. The configuration of such a pGA was essential in influencing the quality of results. In particular providing initial solutions was an important factor. Two novel methods are proposed that generate initial solutions by transforming a production schedule into one with refined production windows. The first method is called factorial generation and the second one fractional generation method. A case study compares the two methods and shows that the factorial method outperforms the fractional one in terms of costs.

The strategy recognizes that traditional DoD methods of requirements development, acquisition oversight, and especially systems engineering are inadequate to produce results in the desired timeframe, in a manner that is receptive to more frequent decision points and opportunities to change direction. In order for these types of systems to evolve and support the type of distributed participation and flexibility that the strategy envisions, they must be designed and (more importantly) specified to expose the necessary interfaces and exhibit sufficient modularity to allow for future growth. This adoption of an open-systems architecture approach represents a potentially significant engineering investment that must be accounted for in acquisition processes, and be made a first-class citizen in planning and scheduling activities. We believe that in order for the U.S. Air Force (and the defense community in general) to truly realize the benefits that come with implementation of agile Capability Development as outlined in the strategy, program offices must: 1) Strive to gain deep, technical knowledge of the system modularity; 2) Specify the critical interfaces to a level of detail to allow capability developers to implement functionality in software; 3) Be able to act as a system integrator to verify and validate that potential component implementations can interoperate successfully within the overall system to accomplish the desired mission. In this paper, we outline a systems engineering approach using a dynamic, executable Model-Based Engineering methodology that we believe can help the government create the systems engineering environment required to implement agile capability development and finally reap its benefits.

For many government and business missions, these systems are used to manage repetitive processes, such as large data-processing and exploitation pipelines. Government missions with strong interactions with the real world are extremely dynamic, as are all missions dealing with error-prone or changing data streams. We contribute a vision for discovery of new steps in adaptive workflow systems, suitability functions that can discover candidate alternatives, and a way forward for sourcing options for decision-makers, without the strong assumptions required by previous work. As data-processing workflows are shared, the sharing entities may find that certain parts of the workflow must be adapted to the new environment of mission. Extremely dynamic environments call for capabilities that support agile operations and pipeline sharing by making it possible to choose relevant actions when a situation invalidates the assumptions of current execution. We adapt some work in schema matching towards this problem, citing key differences between the two sets of challenges.

These tasks are created as refinements of product backlog items at the beginning of each sprint. However, a project team's understanding of the backlog items' business implications and dependencies may often not be deep enough to identify all necessary tasks this early, so in addition to the tasks defined in the beginning of the sprint, more necessary tasks might be discovered as the sprint progresses, making any attempt at progress estimation or risk management difficult. Objective We strive to enable software teams to achieve a deeper understanding of product backlog items, which should help them to identify a sprint's tasks more reliably and comprehensively, and avoid discovering the need for extra tasks during sprint execution. Method We introduced a project team in a medium-sized software development company to the Interaction Room method, which encourages interdisciplinary communication about key system design aspects among all stakeholders. We observed the team's conduct in the sprint planning meetings, and tracked early- vs. late-identified tasks across several sprints. Results Before the introduction of our method, the team used to discover on average 26% of a sprint's tasks not at the beginning of the sprint, but later during the course of the sprint. Using the Interaction Room in two separate projects, this ratio dropped to an average of 5% late-discovered tasks. Conclusion Our observations from these projects suggest that increased communication among all stakeholders of a project leads to a more reliable identification of the tasks to be performed in a sprint, and that an Interaction Room can provide appropriate guidance to conduct this team communication in a focused and pragmatic way.

This paper presents a method to help identify root causes of nonconformities (NCs) using a pattern identification approach. Hereby, a general framework, Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), is adapted. This adaptation involves incorporating an economic concentration measure, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), as the data mining algorithm. After presenting the theoretical background, a new methodology is proposed. The suggested approach can be regarded as a quality tool to help make root cause identification of failures simpler and more agile. A case study from the automotive industry is examined using this tool. Results are obtained and presented in the form of matrix based patterns. They suggest that concentration indices help indicate possible root causes of NCs, warranting further investigation in this area.

Methods Ethnographic investigation using the rapid assessment process, a procedure for agile qualitative data collection and analysis, including clinical observation, system demonstrations and analysis and 91 interviews. Results We identified challenges and lessons learned in eight dimensions: (1) hardware and software computing infrastructure, (2) clinical content, (3) human-computer interface, (4) people, (5) workflow and communication, (6) internal organizational policies, procedures, environment and culture, (7) external rules, regulations, and pressures and (8) system measurement and monitoring. Key challenges included performance issues (particularly related to data retrieval), differences in terminologies used across sites, workflow variability and the need for a legal framework. Discussion Based on the challenges and lessons learned, we identified eight best practices for developers and implementers of service-oriented clinical decision support: (1) optimize performance, or make asynchronous calls, (2) be liberal in what you accept (particularly for terminology), (3) foster clinical transparency, (4) develop a legal framework, (5) support a flexible front-end, (6) dedicate human resources, (7) support peer-to-peer communication, (8) improve standards. Conclusion The Clinical Decision Support Consortium successfully developed a clinical decision support service and implemented it in four different electronic health records and four diverse clinical sites; however, the process was arduous. The lessons identified by the Consortium may be useful for other developers and implementers of clinical decision support services.

This not only holds for processes running within a single enterprise, but also for collaborative scenarios involving distributed and autonomous partners. In particular, if one partner adapts its private process, the change might affect the processes of the other partners as well. Accordingly, it might have to be propagated to concerned partners in a transitive way. A fundamental challenge in this context is to find ways of propagating the changes in a decentralized manner. Existing approaches are limited with respect to the change operations considered as well as their dependency on a particular process specification language. This paper presents a generic change propagation approach that is based on the Refined Process Structure Tree, i.e., the approach is independent of a specific process specification language. Further, it considers a comprehensive set of change patterns. For all these change patterns, it is shown that the provided change propagation algorithms preserve consistency and compatibility of the process choreography. Finally, a proof-of-concept prototype of a change propagation framework for process choreographies is presented. Overall, comprehensive change support in process choreographies will foster the implementation and operational support of agile collaborative process scenarios.

Today, unfortunately, this capability does not exist. Why? Because most suppliers use proprietary information models to represent and share their \\{MSC\\} information! This limits both the semantic precision in the models, which is needed for interoperability, and the level of agility in the supply chains. The availability of a semantically precise and rich reference \\{MSC\\} ontology could address both of these limitations. Based on our prior research, the development of such an ontology will require a semantic mediation process between the proprietary \\{MSC\\} models and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. At the heart of every known, semantic-mediation process is a mapping between a proprietary \\{MSC\\} model and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. Such a mapping must deal with the structural and semantic conflicts between the two. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call canonicalization to address the structural conflicts. The semantic conflicts are addressed using logical mapping. The canonicalization pre-processes the structural representations of the proprietary models and then aligns them using ontology design patterns which are also used in the reference ontology. This simplifies both the mapping problems themselves and the resulting mapping statements considerably. In the paper, we also demonstrate our approach and its benefits in the context of a description-logic-based semantic mediation using the Ontology Web Language (OWL).

In addition to valued input from several vendors, commentary was provided from experienced pharmaceutical representatives, who have installed various continuous platforms. Additionally, a small medium enterprise (SME) perspective was obtained through interviews. A range of technical challenges is outlined, including: the presence of particles, equipment scalability, fouling (and cleaning), technology derisking, specific analytical challenges, and the general requirement of improved technical training. Equipment and analytical companies can make a significant contribution to help the introduction of continuous technology. A key point is that many of these challenges exist in batch processing and are not specific to continuous processing. Backward compatibility of software is not a continuous issue per se. In many cases, there is available learning from other industries. Business models and opportunities through outsourced development partners are also highlighted. Agile smaller companies and academic groups have a key role to play in developing skills, working collaboratively in partnerships, and focusing on solving relevant industry challenges. The precompetitive space differs for vendor companies compared with large pharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no strong consensus around a dominant continuous design, partly because of business dynamics and commercial interests. A more structured common approach to process design and hardware and software standardization would be beneficial, with initial practical steps in modeling. Conclusions include a digestible systems approach, accessible and published business cases, and increased user, academic, and supplier collaboration. This mirrors \\{US\\} \\{FDA\\} direction. The concept of silos in pharmaceutical companies is a common theme throughout the white papers. In the equipment domain, this is equally prevalent among a broad range of companies, mainly focusing on discrete areas. As an example, the flow chemistry and secondary drug product communities are almost entirely disconnected. Control and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT) companies are active in both domains. The equipment actors are a very diverse group with a few major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) players and a variety of SME, project providers, integrators, upstream downstream providers, and specialist PAT. In some cases, partnerships or alliances are formed to increase critical mass. This white paper has focused on small molecules; equipment associated with biopharmaceuticals is covered in a separate white paper. More specifics on equipment detail are provided in final dosage form and drug substance white papers. The equipment and analytical development from laboratory to pilot to production is important, with a variety of sensors and complexity reducing with scale. The importance of robust processing rather than overcomplex control strategy mitigation is important. A search of nonacademic literature highlights, with a few notable exceptions, a relative paucity of material. Much focuses on the economics and benefits of continuous, rather than specifics of equipment issues. The disruptive nature of continuous manufacturing represents either an opportunity or a threat for many companies, so the incentive to change equipment varies. Also, for many companies, the pharmaceutical sector is not actually the dominant sector in terms of sales. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.

Therefore, the development of \\{PSS\\} is an extension of traditional engineering design process, which mainly refers to purely tangible products or intangible services into an integrated development process of products and services. The basis is a new technology called Smart Hybrid Prototyping (SHP), a joint development by Fraunhofer \\{IPK\\} and the \\{TU\\} Berlin. \\{SHP\\} is an innovative technology for a multimodal interdisciplinary evaluation of virtual prototypes in early development stages. It is based upon methods of Mixed Reality extended by modern industrial technologies to allow natural interaction with virtual prototypes of mechanical or mechatronic systems. It serves as a bridge between physical reality and digital virtuality. The use cases in this paper are based on urban bike mobility. Therefore, three concepts have been worked out to specify main requirements for an urban hybrid bike simulator. The first use case is from the perspective of a bicycle rental, where rental services for the users can be developed, validated, and optimized. The second use case provides the integration of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for the development and validation of mobile services for bicyclists. The third use case is oriented on development and validation of new bicycles and urban mobility concepts like e-bikes, pedelecs, tripelecs and sharing services. Based on these generic use cases the requirements on a hybrid bicycle simulator were derived. Why a bicycle simulator?

Sustainable harvest of agaves and populations' recovery actions are needed for protecting this and other agave species similarly threatened. Our study aimed to identify mechanisms determining seedling establishment and sapling plants growth of A. potatorum in order to generate information helpful for enhancing populations' growing and reforestation strategies. We hypothesized that (1) A. potatorum plants are spatially associated, probably species-specific, to shrub species, the frequency of facilitation being higher in the earlier stages of life cycle, varying among sites under different stress conditions, (2) germination and seedling survival are higher beneath nurse plants canopy compared with open areas, seeds and plants from a particular site performing better in the original conditions than in others, (3) nurse plants have a positive effect in the net balance of the growth rate of A. potatorum despite the negative effects of shade on carbon gain. We studied the association of A. potatorum with shrub and tree species by analysing their distribution patterns in two sites with contrasting environments (one relatively more xeric than the other). In these site we conducted experiments for testing seedling establishment and growth of agaves. Reciprocal transplanting experiments tested seed germination and seedling survival of agaves in open areas and beneath nurse plants. Two-years-old saplings were planted in open areas and beneath nurse plants to analyse their relative growth rate. We found a significant association of both young and adult plants to nurse plants, some of them being markedly specific. Germination and survival were higher under nurse plants, we also found negative effects of shade in carbon gain, but growth was higher there than in open spaces. We suggest that protection against solar radiation is a main factor influencing the association. Provenance of seeds was significant for germination success and early establishment. Nurse plants are crucial for the establishment of A. potatorum; however, several species may play the role of nurse plants and these may be different among sites. Therefore, rapid identification of nurse plant species in different vegetation types would allow agile actions for successful reforestation. Manual dispersion of seeds beneath canopies of shrubs that are high quality nurse plants, as well as producing sapling agaves in nurseries and transplanting them after two years associated to nurse plants are recommendable techniques for populations' recovery.

Machine utilization ranged from 68 to 89%, and it was highest in the Nordic trials, due to the use of pre-parked containers, which dramatically reduced the occurrence of interaction delays. Regional differences were only related to operational layout and organization, which set the Nordic trial apart from all others. Knife wear and screen size had a major impact on chipper performance. The same accounted for cut length. Production of small chips is only justified when the market offers premium prices for this assortment.

Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known of the actual metrics use in Agile teams. Objective The objective of this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the used metrics. Method This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process. Results The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning, progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate. Conclusion The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as they can offer the largest impact to the software industry.

Whereas software was once considered a detail to be bundled, it has since become an intricate and interdependent part of most products. The advancement of software increases the uncertainty and the interdependencies between development tasks and artifacts. A key success factor is good requirements engineering (RE), and in particular, the challenges of effectively and efficiently coordinating and communicating requirements. Objective In this work we present a lightweight \\{RE\\} framework and demonstrate and evaluate its industrial applicability in response to the needs of a Swedish automotive company for improving specific problems in inter-departmental requirements coordination and communication in large-scale development of software-intensive systems. Method A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews. Results The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and communicating requirements identified at the case company. However, other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and competences in the early development phases, were identified when using the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken. Conclusion Overall, the experience from using the framework and the positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems related to coordination and communication of requirements. Based on the promising results, our industrial partner has decided upon further validations of the framework in a large-scale pilot program.

Conclusions Based on our study, software teams are engaged in a constant cycle of interpreting their own performance and negotiating its alignment with other stakeholders. While differences across organisational sizes exist, a common set of performance experiences is present despite differences in context variables. Enhancing performance experiences requires integration of soft factors, such as communication, team spirit, team identity, and values, into the overall development process.

Hybrid development models, referred to as user-centered agile software development (UCASD) in this article, propose to combine the merits of both approaches in order to design software that is both useful and usable. Objective This paper aims to capture the current state of the art in \\{UCASD\\} approaches and to derive generic principles from these approaches. More specifically, we investigate the following research question: Which principles constitute a user-centered agile software development approach? Method We conduct a systematic review of the literature on UCASD. Identified works are analyzed using a coding scheme that differentiates four levels of UCASD: the process, practices, people/social and technology dimensions. Through subsequent synthesis, we derive generic principles of UCASD. Results We identified and analyzed 83 relevant publications.

Traditional software development methods are inflexible and fail to respond on aggressive customer requests. In contrast, agile software methodologies provide a set of practices that allow for quick adaptations matching the modern product development needs. Although the value of the agile methodologies is well proven for small, collocated teams, the research question that this work is addressing refers to the benefits of the agile methodologies on large, distributed projects. With this paper, evidence is provided by the analysis of a case study that agile software development methodologies perform better than traditional methodologies also in large, distributed projects.

Following the principles of technical action research, we collaborated with five companies, applying REST-bench and iteratively improving the method based on the lessons we learned. We applied REST-bench both in Agile and plan-driven environments, in projects lasting from weeks to years, and staffed as large as 1000 employees. The improvement opportunities we identified and the feedback we received indicate that the assessment was effective and efficient.

There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of \\{SE\\} practices conducted in industry. Turkey has a vibrant software industry and it is important to characterize and understand the state of its \\{SE\\} practices. Our objective is to characterize and grasp a high-level view on type of \\{SE\\} practices in the Turkish software industry. To achieve this objective, we systematically designed an online survey with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian and Turkish contexts and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Two hundred and two practicing software engineers from the Turkish software industry participated in the survey. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about \\{SE\\} practices in Turkey and beyond. They also help track the profession of SE, and suggest areas for improved training, education and research. Among the findings are the followings: (1) The military and defense software sectors are quite prominent in Turkey, especially in the capital Ankara region, and many \\{SE\\} practitioners work for those companies. (2) 54% of the participants reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33% mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of effort, after the development phase (on average, 31% of overall project effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases come next and have similar average values (14%, 12%, 12% and 11% respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents (53%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38% and 34%, respectively. (6) The Waterfall and Agile methodologies have slight negative correlations, denoting that if one is used in a company, the other will less likely to be used. The results of our survey will be of interest to \\{SE\\} professionals both in Turkey and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in \\{SE\\} industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in those areas.

The research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of composing processes for three software development projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable sequence of components. Findings: The main findings indicate that \\{GA\\} is more effective (best results regarding the fitness function) than \\{HC\\} and \\{RS\\} in the search of solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a context. These \\{SBSE\\} results were complemented by the feedback given by specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity, adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager during the decision making in process composition. Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample prevents generalization for other types of projects or different contexts. Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition, since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile, and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase collaboration in software development. Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area. Finally, this work expands the body of knowledge in \\{SBSE\\} to the field of software process which has not been properly explored by former research.

Method: The method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches. These studies have been identified as case studies regarding the empirical research, as solution proposals regarding the research type, and as evaluation studies regarding the research validation type. Most of the papers used method engineering to implement tailoring and were not specific to any agile method on their scope. Conclusion: Most of agile methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables.

Inter-organisational agile projects possess unique attributes. They involve multiple stakeholders from different organisational contexts and are thus characterised by competing priorities. Team members also lack a mutual awareness of what constitutes work. These issues make the collaboration between project teams challenging. Meanwhile collaboration between usability designers and agile project teams is an integral part of the integration of usability activities into agile development projects. We carried out an interpretive case study on a large inter-organisational agile development project to examine how usability designers and agile project teams collaborate in this project type. Results showed integration goals were achieved through five tactics deployed by the usability designers. These tactics were negotiating inclusion; upward influencing, placating expert users, establishing credibility and diffusing designs. The implications of these findings are summarised in the form of three propositions that pertain to how usability designer-agile project team collaborations might be organised in agile development projects. Further, the role of the usability designer in ensuring the integration of usability activities is also emphasised.

In this research, the particular issue of compliance of Agile Software Development Methodologies (SCRUM, XP, and UPEDU) and the new ISO/IEC 29110 standard is studied. Because the new standard is focused on the software process in very small software development companies or small software project teams in the range from 1 to 25 people, and the Agile Software Development Methodologies (ASDMs) are primarily for same targets, this study is important.

Previous studies on release planning have focused on plan-driven optimization models. Unfortunately, solving the release planning problem mechanistically is difficult in an agile development context. Objective We describe how a release planning method was employed in two case projects in F-Secure, a large Finnish software company. We identify the benefits which the projects gained from the method, and analyze challenges in the cases and improvements made to the method during the case projects. Method We observed five release planning events and four retrospectives and we conducted surveys in the first two events. We conducted six post-project interviews. We conjoined the observation notes, survey results and interviews and analyzed them qualitatively and quantitatively. Results The focal point of the method was release planning events where the whole project organization gathered to plan the next release. The planning was conducted by the development teams in close collaboration with each other and with the other stakeholders. We identified ten benefits which included improved communication, transparency, dependency management and decision making. We identified nine challenges which included the lacking preparation and prioritization of requirements, unrealistic schedules, insufficient architectural planning and lacking agile mindset. The biggest improvements to the method were the introduction of frequent status checks and a big visible planning status board. Conclusion The release planning method ameliorated many difficult characteristics of the release planning problem but its efficiency was negatively affected by the performing organization that was in transition from a plan-driven to an agile development mindset. Even in this case the benefits clearly outweighed the challenges and the method enabled the early identification of the issues in the project.

The \\{CD\\} process aims to immediately deploy software to customers as soon as new code is developed, and can result in a number of benefits for organisations, such as: new business opportunities, reduced risk for each release, and prevent development of wasted software. There is little academic literature on the challenges organisations face when adopting the \\{CD\\} process, however there are many anecdotal challenges that organisations have voiced on their online blogs. Objective The aim of this research is to examine the challenges faced by organisations when adopting \\{CD\\} as well as the strategies to mitigate these challenges. Method An explorative case study technique that involves in-depth interviews with software practitioners in an organisation that has adopted \\{CD\\} was conducted to identify these challenges. Results This study found a total of 20 technical and social adoption challenges that organisations may face when adopting the \\{CD\\} process. The results are discussed to gain a deeper understanding of the strategies employed by organisations to mitigate the impacts of these challenges. Conclusion While a number of individual technical and social adoption challenges were uncovered by the case study in this research, most challenges were not faced in isolation. The severity of these challenges were reduced by a number of mitigation strategies employed by the case study organisation. It is concluded that organisations need to be well prepared to handle technical and social adoption challenges with their existing expertise, processes and tools before adopting the \\{CD\\} process. For practitioners, knowing how to address the challenges an organisation may face when adopting the \\{CD\\} process provides a level of awareness that they previously may not have had.

Requirements engineering and agile methods share common grounds as they both focus on stakeholder collaboration. The key issue is finding a way to study collaboration driven by requirements in geographically distributed agile teams. In this paper, we aim to propose a framework to study collaboration driven by requirements among agile teams and determine the impact of their collaboration patterns on the iteration performance. We define collaboration in terms of communication as information exchange among members, and awareness knowledge of others. Two case studies were conducted to examine communication and awareness network patterns among distributed agile teams. Data were collected through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and onsite observation. The findings revealed that the framework aids in determining the core members, collaboration trends, clustering tendency, communication and awareness reciprocity of the teams, small worldliness and centralisation behaviour of the networks and iteration performance of the agile teams. The framework has implications for the industrial practitioners, i.e. managers to learn about their team's collaboration in order to take measures for performance improvement. At the same time, the researchers can use this framework to study other social aspects in variable settings to produce more empirical results.

Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an \\{IT\\} phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

Organizations' ability to adapt to the fast changing conditions depending on the differing requirements of the customers, depend to a great extend on their ability to become agile. Since change and ambiguity always exist and always will in future, the necessity of the organizations to understand these changes in environment conditions quickly and to be able to respond gains importance every passing day. This requirement provides the wide spreading of agile manufacturing philosophy in organizations. Organizations, due to agile manufacturing, will be able to have the chance of turning the ambiguities in the environment to possibilities. Today, accessing correct and more detailed information became possible however another problem has arisen. This problem is the management of large numerical data stacks and their becoming meaningful. The work of turning raw data into information or making them meaningful can be made with data warehouse and business intelligence tools (data mining, inquiry-reporting, OLAP).

There is a need to model agile enterprise architecture artefacts both at the high and low detailed level for a particular context. ArchiMate is relatively a new high-level architecture modelling standard. There is a growing interest amongst organisations in applying ArchiMate for high-level agile enterprise architecture modelling. However, organisations are unsure how to effectively apply ArchiMate at high-level and integrate it with their existing low detailed level modelling standards in practice for supporting end-to-end agile enterprise architecture modelling. Objective This paper evaluates the applicability and integration of high-level ArchiMate modelling standard with the existing low-level modelling standards such as \\{BPMN\\} (Business Process Model and Notation), \\{UML\\} (Unified Modelling Language), \\{FAML\\} (FAME [Framework for Agent-Oriented Method Engineering] Language), SoaML (Service Oriented Architecture Modelling Language), and \\{BMM\\} (Business Motivation Model). Method A qualitative questionnaire-based evaluation criteria has been developed based on the well-known and comprehensive The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). The evaluation criteria has been applied to evaluate the applicability and integration of the selected six modelling standards from the business, application, infrastructure and extension perspectives. Results Each modelling standard is different in scope. A single modelling standard usually does not provide the kind of support required by the agile enterprise architecture modelling. Based on the review results, a hybrid enterprise architecture modelling approach is proposed. This paper demonstrates the application of the proposed hybrid approach with the help of an agile enterprise architecture modelling case study. Conclusion It is concluded that the ArchiMate does not replace the existing low-level modelling standards, rather it can be used in conjunction with low-level modelling standards. This calls for the adoption of hybrid and integrated approach for agile enterprise architecture modelling.

To facilitate agile development of information systems, this paper offers three contributions. First, we introduce the concept of evolvability as a model quality characteristic. Evolvability refers to the expected implications of future model refactorings, both in terms of complexity of the required database evolution algorithm and in terms of the expected volume of data to evolve. Second, we propose extending the agile development cycle by using database profiling information to suggest adaptations to the conceptual model to improve performance. For every software release, the database profiler identifies and analyses navigational access patterns, and proposes model optimisations based on data characteristics, access patterns and a cost-benefit model. Based on an experimental evaluation of the profiler we discuss why the quality of conceptual models can generally benefit from profiling and how performance measurements convey semantic information. Third, we discuss the flow of semantic information when developing and using information systems. Beyond these contributions, we also make a case for using object databases in agile development environments. However, most of the presented concepts are also applicable to other database paradigms.

We review real estate development models and project management. Project models typically describe a project process as a linear development, from idea, through decisions, execution and delivery. Real estate development projects are no exception. However, reality frequently feed surprises into real estate development projects, creating needs for iterations, where the projects need to be re-defined. We also review agile methods used in IT-projects. The logic in these methods is iterative.This iterative aspect in IT-projects is relevant to real estate development projects as well. This means that real estate development projects have similarities with IT-projects, where the need for iterative development has contributed to the development of agile methods. We illustrate applications of the model, and corresponding time use in the development process. We find that there is significant variation in the time use, along with need for iterations. The time needed for processing a regulation plan in Norway is found to be minimum about one year, but it may take two years or more.

The increasing demand and the intense competition in market sharing are radically changing the way production systems are designed and products are manufactured pushing, in this way, the emergence of new manufacturing technologies and/or paradigms. This scenario encourages manufacturing companies to invest in new and more integrated monitoring and control solutions in order to optimize more and more their production processes to enable a faster fault detection, reducing down-times during production while improving system performances and throughput along time. In accordance with these needs, the research done under the scope of Self-Learning Production Systems (SLPS) tries to enhance the control together with other manufacturing activities (e.g. energy saving, maintenance, lifecycle optimization, etc.). The key assumption is that the integration of context awareness and data mining techniques with traditional monitoring and control solutions will reduce maintenance problems, production line downtimes and manufacturing operational costs while guaranteeing a more efficient management of the manufacturing resources.

More than a million cricketers play cricket daily in India alone and aspire to become professional cricketers. Cricket Talent identification and enhancement is a challenging problem due to lack of quality coaches, meagre infrastructural facilities, and poor linkages of coaching academies &amp; cricket authorities. In India, the problem is even tougher as the majority of the population resides in villages. Many of talented players do not get timely recognition of cricket boards' authorities thus amounting to waste of talent. Many keep on pursuing cricket despite of being non-talented. Due to lack of application of appropriate scientific methods the selection process is also criticized as biased by many. In this paper, we present a web based system viz. Cricket Talent Identification, Enhancement and Selection (C-TIES) for addressing the above issues. C-TIES utilize a cricket talent knowledgebase of experts' opinions aggregated by applying \\{OWA\\} Aggregation Operator and Relative Fuzzy Linguistic Quantifier (RFLQ). The C-TIES system classifies the cricket talent level of an enthusiast into five different classes by applying Normalized Adequacy Coefficient (NAC). The Talent Enhancement and Talent Selection subsystems also uses appropriate algorithms based on OWA, \\{RFLQ\\} and \\{NAC\\} to respectively enable identification of weaknesses in a player and select most talented n-players from a larger group of players. Thus, system reduces the time for identifying weaknesses and also provides a relatively better unbiased selection method for short listing players.

Existing planning methods all suggest that research and analysis should be the first phase, followed by strategy, smart goals and a detailed action plan, and ending with an evaluation of the results. These models provide an undesirable illusion of control. That is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders. Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant publics implicates. That is why preference should be given to the view that communication is not so much communication between two or more actors but is a multi-way diachronic process of ongoing constructions of meanings in which one cannot foresee who is - or will be - involved, in what way, and what the results will be. To be successful, a more flexible planning method is needed in which change is a defining part during the process. Scrum is such a method. To make it applicable in public relations, this agile method, well-known in IT, needed to be expanded by supplementing theory on communication, change and reflectivity, and by enrichment of the common notion of evaluation.

Research however has historically taken the perspective that stochastic demand is stationary therefore limiting its impact for practitioners. Manufacturers require schedules for multiple products that decide the quantity to be produced over a required time span. This work investigated the challenges for production in the framework of a single manufacturing line with multiple products and varying demand. The nature of varying demand of numerous products lends itself naturally to an agile manufacturing approach. We propose a new algorithm that iteratively refines production windows and adds products. This algorithm controls parallel genetic algorithms (pGA) that find production schedules while minimizing costs. The configuration of such a pGA was essential in influencing the quality of results. In particular providing initial solutions was an important factor. Two novel methods are proposed that generate initial solutions by transforming a production schedule into one with refined production windows. The first method is called factorial generation and the second one fractional generation method. A case study compares the two methods and shows that the factorial method outperforms the fractional one in terms of costs.

The strategy recognizes that traditional DoD methods of requirements development, acquisition oversight, and especially systems engineering are inadequate to produce results in the desired timeframe, in a manner that is receptive to more frequent decision points and opportunities to change direction. In order for these types of systems to evolve and support the type of distributed participation and flexibility that the strategy envisions, they must be designed and (more importantly) specified to expose the necessary interfaces and exhibit sufficient modularity to allow for future growth. This adoption of an open-systems architecture approach represents a potentially significant engineering investment that must be accounted for in acquisition processes, and be made a first-class citizen in planning and scheduling activities. We believe that in order for the U.S. Air Force (and the defense community in general) to truly realize the benefits that come with implementation of agile Capability Development as outlined in the strategy, program offices must: 1) Strive to gain deep, technical knowledge of the system modularity; 2) Specify the critical interfaces to a level of detail to allow capability developers to implement functionality in software; 3) Be able to act as a system integrator to verify and validate that potential component implementations can interoperate successfully within the overall system to accomplish the desired mission. In this paper, we outline a systems engineering approach using a dynamic, executable Model-Based Engineering methodology that we believe can help the government create the systems engineering environment required to implement agile capability development and finally reap its benefits.

For many government and business missions, these systems are used to manage repetitive processes, such as large data-processing and exploitation pipelines. Government missions with strong interactions with the real world are extremely dynamic, as are all missions dealing with error-prone or changing data streams. We contribute a vision for discovery of new steps in adaptive workflow systems, suitability functions that can discover candidate alternatives, and a way forward for sourcing options for decision-makers, without the strong assumptions required by previous work. As data-processing workflows are shared, the sharing entities may find that certain parts of the workflow must be adapted to the new environment of mission. Extremely dynamic environments call for capabilities that support agile operations and pipeline sharing by making it possible to choose relevant actions when a situation invalidates the assumptions of current execution. We adapt some work in schema matching towards this problem, citing key differences between the two sets of challenges.

These tasks are created as refinements of product backlog items at the beginning of each sprint. However, a project team's understanding of the backlog items' business implications and dependencies may often not be deep enough to identify all necessary tasks this early, so in addition to the tasks defined in the beginning of the sprint, more necessary tasks might be discovered as the sprint progresses, making any attempt at progress estimation or risk management difficult. Objective We strive to enable software teams to achieve a deeper understanding of product backlog items, which should help them to identify a sprint's tasks more reliably and comprehensively, and avoid discovering the need for extra tasks during sprint execution. Method We introduced a project team in a medium-sized software development company to the Interaction Room method, which encourages interdisciplinary communication about key system design aspects among all stakeholders. We observed the team's conduct in the sprint planning meetings, and tracked early- vs. late-identified tasks across several sprints. Results Before the introduction of our method, the team used to discover on average 26% of a sprint's tasks not at the beginning of the sprint, but later during the course of the sprint. Using the Interaction Room in two separate projects, this ratio dropped to an average of 5% late-discovered tasks. Conclusion Our observations from these projects suggest that increased communication among all stakeholders of a project leads to a more reliable identification of the tasks to be performed in a sprint, and that an Interaction Room can provide appropriate guidance to conduct this team communication in a focused and pragmatic way.

Total Quality Management (TQM) provides several quality oriented tools and techniques which, in the event of things, are not always applicable. The increased use of Information Technology (IT) in manufacturing means increased data availability and improved potential for knowledge extraction. Exploiting this knowledge requires data storage and processing facilities with demanding, time consuming sessions for interpretation. Without suitable tools and techniques, knowledge remains hidden in databases. This paper presents a method to help identify root causes of nonconformities (NCs) using a pattern identification approach. Hereby, a general framework, Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), is adapted. This adaptation involves incorporating an economic concentration measure, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), as the data mining algorithm. After presenting the theoretical background, a new methodology is proposed. The suggested approach can be regarded as a quality tool to help make root cause identification of failures simpler and more agile. A case study from the automotive industry is examined using this tool. Results are obtained and presented in the form of matrix based patterns. They suggest that concentration indices help indicate possible root causes of NCs, warranting further investigation in this area.

Methods Ethnographic investigation using the rapid assessment process, a procedure for agile qualitative data collection and analysis, including clinical observation, system demonstrations and analysis and 91 interviews. Results We identified challenges and lessons learned in eight dimensions: (1) hardware and software computing infrastructure, (2) clinical content, (3) human-computer interface, (4) people, (5) workflow and communication, (6) internal organizational policies, procedures, environment and culture, (7) external rules, regulations, and pressures and (8) system measurement and monitoring. Key challenges included performance issues (particularly related to data retrieval), differences in terminologies used across sites, workflow variability and the need for a legal framework. Discussion Based on the challenges and lessons learned, we identified eight best practices for developers and implementers of service-oriented clinical decision support: (1) optimize performance, or make asynchronous calls, (2) be liberal in what you accept (particularly for terminology), (3) foster clinical transparency, (4) develop a legal framework, (5) support a flexible front-end, (6) dedicate human resources, (7) support peer-to-peer communication, (8) improve standards.

This not only holds for processes running within a single enterprise, but also for collaborative scenarios involving distributed and autonomous partners. In particular, if one partner adapts its private process, the change might affect the processes of the other partners as well. Accordingly, it might have to be propagated to concerned partners in a transitive way. A fundamental challenge in this context is to find ways of propagating the changes in a decentralized manner. Existing approaches are limited with respect to the change operations considered as well as their dependency on a particular process specification language. This paper presents a generic change propagation approach that is based on the Refined Process Structure Tree, i.e., the approach is independent of a specific process specification language. Further, it considers a comprehensive set of change patterns. For all these change patterns, it is shown that the provided change propagation algorithms preserve consistency and compatibility of the process choreography. Finally, a proof-of-concept prototype of a change propagation framework for process choreographies is presented. Overall, comprehensive change support in process choreographies will foster the implementation and operational support of agile collaborative process scenarios.

These inflexible approaches are typically not able to cope with the complexities of the manufacturing environment, such as the instabilities, uncertainties and abrupt changes caused by internal and external disturbances, or a large number and variety of interacting, interdependent elements. A paradigm shift, e.g., novel organizing principles and methods, is needed for supporting the interoperability of dynamic alliances of agile and networked systems. Several solution proposals argue that the future of manufacturing and logistics lies in network-like, dynamic, open and reconfigurable systems of cooperative autonomous entities. The paper overviews various distributed approaches and technologies of control engineering and \\{ICT\\} that can support the realization of cooperative structures from the resource level to the level of networked enterprises. Standard results as well as recent advances from control theory, through cooperative game theory, distributed machine learning to holonic systems, cooperative enterprise modeling, system integration, and autonomous logistics processes are surveyed. A special emphasis is put on the theoretical developments and industrial applications of Robustly Feasible Model Predictive Control (RFMPC). Two case studies are also discussed: (i) a holonic, PROSA-based approach to generate short-term forecasts for an additive manufacturing system by means of a delegate multi-agent system (D-MAS); and (ii) an application of distributed \\{RFMPC\\} to a drinking water distribution system.

A substantial amount of agency administrative information - big data - can be transformed into knowledge for policy and management actions through a rigorous information generation process. Important properties of the information generation process are that it must generate accurate, timely information while protecting the confidentiality of the clients. In addition, it must be extensible to serve an ever-changing policy and technology environment. Knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD), aka data science, is a method developed in the private sector to mine consumer data and can be used in public settings to support evidence based governance. \\{KDD\\} consists of a rigorous 5-step process that includes a Web-based end-user interface.

Today, unfortunately, this capability does not exist. Why? Because most suppliers use proprietary information models to represent and share their \\{MSC\\} information! This limits both the semantic precision in the models, which is needed for interoperability, and the level of agility in the supply chains. The availability of a semantically precise and rich reference \\{MSC\\} ontology could address both of these limitations. Based on our prior research, the development of such an ontology will require a semantic mediation process between the proprietary \\{MSC\\} models and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. At the heart of every known, semantic-mediation process is a mapping between a proprietary \\{MSC\\} model and the reference \\{MSC\\} ontology. Such a mapping must deal with the structural and semantic conflicts between the two. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call canonicalization to address the structural conflicts. The semantic conflicts are addressed using logical mapping. The canonicalization pre-processes the structural representations of the proprietary models and then aligns them using ontology design patterns which are also used in the reference ontology. This simplifies both the mapping problems themselves and the resulting mapping statements considerably. In the paper, we also demonstrate our approach and its benefits in the context of a description-logic-based semantic mediation using the Ontology Web Language (OWL).

In addition to valued input from several vendors, commentary was provided from experienced pharmaceutical representatives, who have installed various continuous platforms. Additionally, a small medium enterprise (SME) perspective was obtained through interviews. A range of technical challenges is outlined, including: the presence of particles, equipment scalability, fouling (and cleaning), technology derisking, specific analytical challenges, and the general requirement of improved technical training. Equipment and analytical companies can make a significant contribution to help the introduction of continuous technology. A key point is that many of these challenges exist in batch processing and are not specific to continuous processing. Backward compatibility of software is not a continuous issue per se. In many cases, there is available learning from other industries. Business models and opportunities through outsourced development partners are also highlighted. Agile smaller companies and academic groups have a key role to play in developing skills, working collaboratively in partnerships, and focusing on solving relevant industry challenges. The precompetitive space differs for vendor companies compared with large pharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no strong consensus around a dominant continuous design, partly because of business dynamics and commercial interests. A more structured common approach to process design and hardware and software standardization would be beneficial, with initial practical steps in modeling. Conclusions include a digestible systems approach, accessible and published business cases, and increased user, academic, and supplier collaboration. This mirrors \\{US\\} \\{FDA\\} direction. The concept of silos in pharmaceutical companies is a common theme throughout the white papers. In the equipment domain, this is equally prevalent among a broad range of companies, mainly focusing on discrete areas. As an example, the flow chemistry and secondary drug product communities are almost entirely disconnected. Control and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT) companies are active in both domains. The equipment actors are a very diverse group with a few major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) players and a variety of SME, project providers, integrators, upstream downstream providers, and specialist PAT. In some cases, partnerships or alliances are formed to increase critical mass. This white paper has focused on small molecules; equipment associated with biopharmaceuticals is covered in a separate white paper. More specifics on equipment detail are provided in final dosage form and drug substance white papers. The equipment and analytical development from laboratory to pilot to production is important, with a variety of sensors and complexity reducing with scale. The importance of robust processing rather than overcomplex control strategy mitigation is important. A search of nonacademic literature highlights, with a few notable exceptions, a relative paucity of material. Much focuses on the economics and benefits of continuous, rather than specifics of equipment issues. The disruptive nature of continuous manufacturing represents either an opportunity or a threat for many companies, so the incentive to change equipment varies. Also, for many companies, the pharmaceutical sector is not actually the dominant sector in terms of sales. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.

This research includes an \\{EU\\} funded 3 year project HoliDes - Holistic Human Factors and System Design of Adaptive Cooperative Human Machine Systems. Continuous engineering within Airbus has included various corporate and divisional Synergy programs and lean and agile initiatives. As our business is defined by Multiple Portfolio products, supplied from multi countries, the \\{MBSE\\} process had to speed up delivery and reduce overall cost. The Airbus process models needed significant amendment due to products supplied via multiple business lines throughout the company. This problem is exacerbated by varying requirements of four national defence requirements, who impose restrictions on the use of Architectural Frameworks (NAF/MODAF/DODAF) and supporting tools. Our Human System Integration (HSI) is continuing from the initial Human View Architectural Framework research to include the nine \\{HSI\\} domains. These nine domains overlap with our current Human factors research and will now allow us to pull in our Non-functional work into our Systems Engineering lifecycle. This paper highlights the research projects Airbus Space and Defence are incorporating in to our overall strategy, these include internal R&amp;D funding and European Union funded research programs. These research projects have highlighted several areas of interest these include, stochastic modelling with respect to Human System Integration and Human views, verification and analysis of emergent behaviour and non-functional properties, which conforms with our own work on non-functional requirements and finally the use of System of System Formal Methods for parts of the lifecycle.

It is based upon methods of Mixed Reality extended by modern industrial technologies to allow natural interaction with virtual prototypes of mechanical or mechatronic systems. It serves as a bridge between physical reality and digital virtuality. The use cases in this paper are based on urban bike mobility. Therefore, three concepts have been worked out to specify main requirements for an urban hybrid bike simulator. The first use case is from the perspective of a bicycle rental, where rental services for the users can be developed, validated, and optimized. The second use case provides the integration of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for the development and validation of mobile services for bicyclists. The third use case is oriented on development and validation of new bicycles and urban mobility concepts like e-bikes, pedelecs, tripelecs and sharing services. Based on these generic use cases the requirements on a hybrid bicycle simulator were derived. Why a bicycle simulator? Well, we are firmly convinced that the future of urban mobility is determined from trends such as ecological rethinking and the desire for sports and healthy life.

Sustainable harvest of agaves and populations' recovery actions are needed for protecting this and other agave species similarly threatened. Our study aimed to identify mechanisms determining seedling establishment and sapling plants growth of A. potatorum in order to generate information helpful for enhancing populations' growing and reforestation strategies. We hypothesized that (1) A. potatorum plants are spatially associated, probably species-specific, to shrub species, the frequency of facilitation being higher in the earlier stages of life cycle, varying among sites under different stress conditions, (2) germination and seedling survival are higher beneath nurse plants canopy compared with open areas, seeds and plants from a particular site performing better in the original conditions than in others, (3) nurse plants have a positive effect in the net balance of the growth rate of A. potatorum despite the negative effects of shade on carbon gain. We studied the association of A. potatorum with shrub and tree species by analysing their distribution patterns in two sites with contrasting environments (one relatively more xeric than the other). In these site we conducted experiments for testing seedling establishment and growth of agaves. Reciprocal transplanting experiments tested seed germination and seedling survival of agaves in open areas and beneath nurse plants. Two-years-old saplings were planted in open areas and beneath nurse plants to analyse their relative growth rate. We found a significant association of both young and adult plants to nurse plants, some of them being markedly specific. Germination and survival were higher under nurse plants, we also found negative effects of shade in carbon gain, but growth was higher there than in open spaces. We suggest that protection against solar radiation is a main factor influencing the association. Provenance of seeds was significant for germination success and early establishment. Nurse plants are crucial for the establishment of A. potatorum; however, several species may play the role of nurse plants and these may be different among sites. Therefore, rapid identification of nurse plant species in different vegetation types would allow agile actions for successful reforestation. Manual dispersion of seeds beneath canopies of shrubs that are high quality nurse plants, as well as producing sapling agaves in nurseries and transplanting them after two years associated to nurse plants are recommendable techniques for populations' recovery.

The same machine and operator were used for all tests, which lasted 65 h and produced over 100 chip containers. Productivity varied between 13 and 19 tonnes of green chips per scheduled hour, inclusive of all delays. Fuel consumption ranged from 1.8 to 2.8 dm3 of diesel per tonne of green chips. Machine utilization ranged from 68 to 89%, and it was highest in the Nordic trials, due to the use of pre-parked containers, which dramatically reduced the occurrence of interaction delays. Regional differences were only related to operational layout and organization, which set the Nordic trial apart from all others. Knife wear and screen size had a major impact on chipper performance. The same accounted for cut length. Production of small chips is only justified when the market offers premium prices for this assortment.
