In\n   this article, the authors discuss the pressures on companies to disclose\n   supply chain information, the drivers and impediments to such\n   disclosure, and the types of supply chain information typically made\n   available to the public. The article identifies the broad disclosure\n   strategies companies can use to release supply chain information and\n   offers managers guidance on designing the optimal disclosure strategy\n   for their company. In addition to exploring the topic with examples from\n   companies including Nike Inc., WD-40, and Patagonia Inc., the authors\n   take a detailed look at how Apple's approach to supply chain disclosure\n   has evolved since 2009.\n   In considering how to manage supply chain information disclosure, the\n   authors argue that managers must appreciate the diverse forces and\n   actors driving and enabling this trend. Aside from internal governance\n   and risk concerns, external pressure has come from government\n   regulations, best practices of peers, changing expectations from salient\n   stakeholder groups, and, of course, external events (such as the 2013\n   Rana Plaza garment factory collapse in Bangladesh).\n   The authors note that improving transparency can be expensive. The lack\n   of standardized reporting systems, the absence of a common technology\n   platform, ill-defined standards, and a lack of supplier education can\n   also pose serious hindrances to companies wishing to improve their\n   supply chain transparency.\n   The authors identify four common types of supply chain information that\n   tends to be publicly disclosed: supply chain membership, provenance of\n   materials, environmental information, and information on social impacts\n   such as working conditions. Based on their research, they developed a\n   transparency matrix to frame four typical supply chain disclosure\n   strategies: transparent, secret, distracting, and withheld. The authors\n   say managers must understand the demands and respond in creative and\n   meaningful ways without undermining the competitive advantage of their\n   company. The tools and advice presented in the article can help managers\n   navigate this complex and evolving area.}","ISSN":"{1532-9194}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000367206300009}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000385474200013","entryType":"article","entryTags":{"Author":"Furr, Nathan and O'Keeffe, Kate and Dyer, Jeffrey H.","Title":"{Managing Multiparty Innovation}","Journal":"{HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW}","Year":"{2016}","Volume":"{91}","Number":"{11}","Pages":"{76+}","Month":"{NOV}","Abstract":"{In an increasingly digital and connected environment, leaders of\n   established companies frequently find themselves facing opportunities\n   that they or even their industries cannot seize alone.

This paper proposes and compares two\n   interventions to reduce age stereotypes in software development. An\n   awareness-based intervention was conducted on-the job, as a\n   quasi-experiment with 56 participants. A cooperation-based workshop was\n   conducted as a field experiment with 74 employees. Both types of\n   interventions reduced bias in performance and innovation expectations\n   favoring middle-aged over older employees. The reduction in biases held\n   by developers was particularly strong. Only the cooperation-based\n   intervention reduced bias toward both older and younger employees. This\n   intervention led to a long-term (six months) reduction in bias,\n   regarding developer performance expectations. The study extends the\n   diversity training literature in establishing causal, long-term effects\n   for age stereotype reduction in the field. Furthermore, it contributes\n   to the literature by indicating that contact hypothesis can not only be\n   applied to reduce age stereotypes toward older but also toward younger\n   employees. The design enables practitioners to create on-the-job\n   diversity interventions that employees are willing to attend, and, thus,\n   to reach a majority of employees without interventions being mandatory.\n   (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This\n   paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting\n   communication in AGSD.

A key design\n   criterion in network design is the ability to recover from failures in\n   an agile and efficient manner. Protection capabilities are highly\n   required in optical networks since the failure of an optical link might\n   potentially lead to a significant traffic loss. Under this context,\n   Network Coding Protection (NCP) has emerged as an innovative solution to\n   proactively enable protection in an agile and efficient manner by means\n   of throughput improvement techniques such as Network Coding (NC).\n   Nevertheless, the benefits of NC can be reduced by the negative effects\n   of inaccurate Network State Information (NSI), which are common in\n   dynamic scenarios.\n   In this paper, we propose a novel proactive protection strategy based on\n   NC jointly with a Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture called\n   Predictive Network Coding Protection (PNCP). PNCP leverages predictive\n   techniques in order to mitigate the negative impact of the inaccurate\n   NSI on the blocking probability. In addition, PNCP computes resilient\n   lightpaths with a low amount of network resources devoted for path\n   protection.\n   By means of extensive simulation results we show that in comparison with\n   proactive protection strategies such as Dedicated Path Protection (DPP),\n   and conventional dynamic NCP, PNCP reduces the blocking probability as\n   well as the network resources allocated for path protection in dynamic\n   scenarios.

NFV exposes a new\n   set of entities, the virtualized network functions (VNFs). The VNFs can\n   be chained with other VNFs and physical network functions to realize\n   network services. This flexibility introduced by NFV allows service\n   providers to respond in an agile manner to variable service demands and\n   changing business goals. In this context, the efficient establishment of\n   service chains and their placement becomes essential to reduce capital\n   and operational expenses and gain in service agility. This paper\n   addresses the placement aspect of these service chains by finding the\n   best locations and hosts for the VNFs and to steer traffic across these\n   functions while respecting user requirements and maximizing provider\n   revenue. We propose a novel eigendecomposition-based approach for the\n   placement of virtual and physical network function chains in networks\n   and cloud environments. A heuristic based on a custom greedy algorithm\n   is also presented to compare performance and assess the capability of\n   the eigendecomposition approach. The performance of both algorithms is\n   compared to a multi-stage-based method from the state of the art that\n   also addresses the chaining of network services.

It relies on the analysis of an original, qualitative study\n   of agile software development teams, which operate in an environment\n   characterized by the simultaneous implementation of interdependent\n   organizational routines. We argue that the interdependencies among\n   routines are seized by organizational members who manipulate the level\n   of `protection' that each routine is granted (i.e. the enforcement of\n   adherence to the routine). Less protection permits flexibility, whereas\n   more protection creates stability.

The interplay of these two\n   dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can\n   vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or\n   their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and\n   flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling\n   the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their\n   protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility.

For the benefit of academia and\n   industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and\n   their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken.\n   Objective: This paper investigates two research questions: what\n   challenges do agile, practitioners face? and, how do practitioner\n   challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to\n   map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge\n   characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify\n   implications for research that is relevant to practice.\n   Method: A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner\n   challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner\n   events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis\n   and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to\n   previous publications.\n   Results: Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under\n   27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation,\n   sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one\n   challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which\n   were inter-related. Over 50\\% of survey respondents experienced\n   challenges highlighted in the case study.\n   Conclusion: The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex\n   and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile\n   environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and\n   may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social\n   and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural\n   change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while\n   others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such\n   as governance and contracts, are under-researched, While others, such as\n   business and IT transformation, have been researched but findings{''}\n   have not had the expected impact.

The present research compensates this research gap and\n   the authors developed a model pertaining to MCDM, which answered towards\n   said dilemma. The OFPI has been evaluated by availing same data\n   excluding priority weights of individual 1st level measures.\n   Furthermore, a revised ranking approach accompanied with fuzzy\n   performance important index has fruitfully been implemented to identify\n   the barriers/ill-strong measures.}","DOI":"{10.4018/IJDSST.2016070101}","ISSN":"{1941-6296}","EISSN":"{1941-630X}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000383185800001}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382991200018","entryType":"article","entryTags":{"Author":"Bernhardt, Paul A. and Siefring, Carl L. and Briczinski, Stanley J. and\n   McCarrick, Mike and Michell, Robert G.","Title":"{Large ionospheric disturbances produced by the HAARP HF facility}","Journal":"{RADIO SCIENCE}","Year":"{2016}","Volume":"{51}","Number":"{7}","Pages":"{1081-1093}","Month":"{JUL}","Abstract":"{The enormous transmitter power, fully programmable antenna array, and\n   agile frequency generation of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research\n   Program (HAARP) facility in Alaska have allowed the production of\n   unprecedented disturbances in the ionosphere.

However, they are usually slower than wheel\n   based climbing robots. Within this research we address this problem by\n   integration of a light-weight arm and adhesion mechanism into an\n   omnidirectional wheel based climbing robot, thus forming a hybrid\n   mechanism that is agile in climbing and still able to perform plane\n   transition. A 2DOF (Degree of Freedom) plannar mechanism with 2 linear\n   actuators was designed as a light-weight manipulator for the transition\n   mechanism. Furthermore, we customized and developed actuated switchable\n   magnets both for the robot chassis and also as the adhesion unit of the\n   arm. These units allow us to control the amount of magnetic adhesion\n   force, resulting in better adaptation to different surface\n   characteristics.

As a result of these benefits, applications based on\n   the paradigm are commonly used in the industry. However, the more\n   complex software solutions become, the higher the chance of having bugs\n   is. Identifying them in the entire solution may also be one of the most\n   tedious, expensive and time-consuming activity within the developing\n   process. Therefore, fault localization aims at finding the location of\n   faults, determining the root cause of the failure and identifying the\n   causes of abnormal behavior of a faulty program. In particular, fault\n   localization for service oriented applications is currently a research\n   field that has received little attention. In this context, we present a\n   taxonomy-based approach for fault localization in service oriented\n   applications, using information of faults in the underlying architecture\n   of these applications, namely SOA. The results on the location of faults\n   are not only provided to the developer but also enhanced with\n   architectural information, that is, showing the faults and their\n   connection with exceptions, code and architectural scenarios. The\n   experimental results carried out indicate that developers reduce their\n   effort of localizing faults in terms of time and lines of code.}","ISSN":"{1548-0992}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000381583000041}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000379863500001","entryType":"article","entryTags":{"Author":"Beck, Roman and Pahlke, Immanuel and Vykoukal, Jens","Title":"{Colocation as a Hybrid ICT Sourcing Strategy to Improve Operational\n   Agility}","Journal":"{DATA BASE FOR ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS}","Year":"{2016}","Volume":"{47}","Number":"{2}","Pages":"{9-35}","Month":"{MAY}","Abstract":"{Fast access to communication networks and the availability of\n   high-performance information and communication technology (ICT)\n   infrastructures is indispensable for accelerating business transactions.\n   Yet with increased environmental volatility, companies need to become\n   more agile in identifying and responding to market- and technology-based\n   challenges.

However, many existing cryptographic\n   mechanisms are tightly integrated into communication protocols. Issues\n   emerge when security vulnerabilities are discovered in cryptographic\n   mechanisms because their replacement would eventually require replacing\n   deployed protocols. The concept of cryptographic agility is the solution\n   to these issues because it allows dynamic switching of cryptographic\n   algorithms and keys prior to and during the communication. Most of\n   today's secure protocols implement cryptographic agility (IPsec,\n   SSL/TLS, SSH), but cryptographic agility mechanisms cannot be used in a\n   standalone manner. In order to deal with the aforementioned limitations,\n   we propose a lightweight cryptographically agile agreement model, which\n   is formally verified.

For cognitive radio applications in\n   particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet\n   suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading\n   to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent\n   OFDM-based standards such as IEEE 802.11p for vehicular communication\n   and IEEE 802.11af for TV whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum\n   emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter\n   masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral\n   efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these\n   strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p\n   and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling\n   cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds\n   baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the\n   specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while\n   allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a\n   single basic channel without violating SEM specifications. The proposed\n   method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict RF filter\n   requirements, allowing the RF subsystem to be implemented using much\n   less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions.

A case study in seafood production\n   is analysed from an end-to-end perspective in the flow of seafood from\n   Norway to Japan to investigate how practitioners describe trading and\n   the terminology used on trading embedded across the complete supply\n   network. Four subcases that focus on how goods are traded are studied.\n   Two subcases consider raw material supply, aquaculture-supplied salmon\n   and wild-caught pelagic fish. The third subcase concerns the export of\n   frozen mackerel to Japan, and the final subcase concerns seafood trading\n   at a regional wholesale market in Japan. Analysis is based on the view\n   that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a\n   production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are\n   interdependent.

Markets emerge as\n   nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange\n   facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm\n   is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange\n   facilitate agile seafood distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A proper understanding of a user story also requires an\n   understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation\n   of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding\n   the context of a user story.\n   Objective: We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of\n   execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making\n   use of business process models. The method associates user stories with\n   the corresponding business process model activity element.\n   Method: We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define\n   our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed\n   method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates\n   a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process\n   model can be used to infer information about the execution order and\n   integration dependencies of the user story.

Existing tools typically only address a specific part\n   of the problem (e.g., control plane verification, flow checker). In this\n   paper, we propose a new approach to tackle SDN fault localization by\n   automatically Modeling via Policy Inference (called MPI) the causality\n   between SDN faults and their symptoms to a belief network. In the MPI\n   system, a service oriented high level policy language is used to specify\n   network services provisioned between end nodes. MPI parses each service\n   provisioning policy to a logical policy view, which consists of a pair\n   of logical end nodes, a traffic pattern specification, and a list of\n   required network functions (or a service function chain). An SDN\n   controller takes the policies from multiple parties and provisions the\n   requested services on its orchestrated SDN network. MPI queries the\n   controller about the network topology and retrieves flow rules from all\n   SDN switches. MPI maps the policy view to the corresponding\n   implementation view, in which all the logical components in the policy\n   view are mapped to the actual system components along with the actual\n   network topology. Referring to the component causality graph templates\n   derived from SDN reference model, the implementation view of the current\n   running network services can be modeled as a belief network. A heuristic\n   fault reasoning algorithm is adopted to search for the most likely root\n   causes. MPI has been evaluated in both a simulation environment and a\n   real network system for its accuracy and efficiency.

Furthermore, throttling unnecessarily\n   sacrifices I/O response times by idling the disk. We propose a technique\n   that resizes the queues of the disk to cap its power. Resizing queues\n   not only imposes no delays on servicing requests, but also enables\n   performance differentiation. We present the design and implementation of\n   PCAP, an agile performance-aware power capping system for the disk\n   drive. PCAP dynamically resizes the disk's queues to cap power. It\n   operates in two performance-aware modes, throughput and tail-latency,\n   making it viable for cloud systems with service-level differentiation.\n   We evaluate PCAP for different workloads and disk drives. Our\n   experiments show that PCAP reduces power by up to 22\\%. Further, under\n   PCAP, 60\\% of the requests observe service times below 100 ms compared\n   to just 10\\% under throttling. PCAP also reduces worst-case latency by\n   50\\% and increases throughput by 32\\% relative to throttling.}","ISBN":"{978-1-931971-28-7}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000385264300017}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382938100458","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Hughes, Stuart and Langston, Jerrod S. and DeSalvo, Richard and\n   Middleton, Charles and Grafer, Elliot and Ralph, Stephen E. and Stark,\n   Andrew J.","Book-Group-Author":"{IEEE}","Title":"{Agile Micro- and Millimeter-Wave Communication Using Photonic Frequency\n   Conversion}","Booktitle":"{2016 OPTICAL FIBER COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION (OFC)}","Year":"{2016}","Note":"{Optical Fiber Communications Conference and Exhibition (OFC), Anaheim,\n   CA, MAR 20-24, 2016}","Abstract":"{Broadband wireless transmission with tunable 5-40GHz carrier is\n   demonstrated using photonic frequency conversion.

This technology has become established in many applications\n   including laser based tracking, 3D scanning, biomedical imaging,\n   free-space communication, and LiDAR. However, for certain defense\n   applications, the total angle x diameter product, or the mirror's\n   effective achievable resolution (theta{*}D product), has not been large\n   enough to address requirements for agile steering in large fields of\n   regard and with a low diffraction-limited beam divergence.

The rotating\n   electrostatic combdrive has its torque multiplied by liquid's relative\n   permittivity of similar to 2.5. Furthermore, by selecting the\n   appropriate fluid viscosity, quality factor of the device is reduced and\n   structural damping is tuned to near critical damping. Finally, the\n   increased scan angle due to the similar to 1.5-1.7 index of refraction\n   of the fluid is an additional benefit. These numerous benefits of the\n   fluidic packaging enabled us to double and in some cases triple the\n   previously achieved theta{*}D product of two-axis quasistatic MEMS\n   mirrors while still maintaining speeds applicable for above mentioned\n   applications.

It is\n   hard to make developers work faster but it is possible to make them work\n   more efficient. One way to achieve that is to introduce agile\n   development methods. Agile methods are gaining increasing popularity in\n   safety critical areas such as the petrochemical industry. Agile methods\n   promise reduced costs and shorter time to market through incremental\n   development, less production of unnecessary documents and more\n   maintainable code. The IEC 61511: 2003 standard is normally used by the\n   petrochemical industry. The second edition of this standard will be\n   issued in 2015.\n   Both the current and the new draft edition IEC 61511: 2014 of the IEC\n   61511 standard are evaluated against agile development approach in this\n   paper. Both editions of the IEC 61511 standard have a strong link to IEC\n   61508. Manufacturers and suppliers of devices shall use IEC 61508, while\n   system designers, integrators and users shall use IEC 61511. The IEC\n   61508 standard's relationship to agile development has been evaluated\n   with success in a previous paper (Stalhane 2012).\n   While the architectural design also in agile development is done up\n   front, detailed design is done incrementally. Based on reported\n   experiences in other domains, we expect the following benefits:\n   Easier to discover and correct faulty or incomplete system requirements\n   Simpler software, thus reducing the development and maintenance costs\n   Only documents that are needed, either for certification or development,\n   are developed The ones that are developed are used and kept up-to-date\n   Improved opportunities for reuse and site development.\n   The challenge is to introduce agile development without compromising\n   safety. Development of safety systems needs to be compliant with IEC\n   61511. This standard impose rigor and additional costs, but proper\n   adaptation of agile methods can add flexibility and efficiency. In order\n   to evaluate this proposition we use a three step process:\n   Go through all relevant requirements in the standard and mark all\n   requirements as (1) fully met using agile development, (2) possible to\n   meet using agile development and (3) cannot be fulfilled ``as is{''}\n   using agile development.\n   All requirements in category (2) are studied further in order to assign\n   them to category (1) - OK, category (2) adaptations to the agile method\n   by including add-on's or category (3) - changes to the development\n   process.\n   Suggest appropriate modifications to the agile development.\n   This is the same process that we have used with success for IEC 61508\n   (Stalhane 2012) and IEC 60880 (Stalhane 2013). The work on IEC 61508\n   resulted in a method called SafeScrum. The SafeScrum model are reused\n   and improved to fit the current and new edition of IEC 61511. There are\n   no requirements in the current standards that prevents for an adjusted\n   agile development process as SafeScrum.\n   When the issues identified as category 2 in section 2 are settled, it\n   should be straight forward to use SafeScrum and still be IEC 61511\n   conformant. It is now important to get one or more companies to try it\n   out in cooperation with the certification bodies and / or authorities to\n   get a reality check of the concepts discussed. This will allow us to\n   identify possible problems and to make the adjustments necessary for\n   industrial application. The main challenges are the IEC 61511\n   requirements on configuration management, traceability, detailed\n   planning and documentation.\n   However, in order to reap the full benefits of agile development, it is\n   not enough to show conformance to IEC 61511. Suggested improvements of\n   IEC 61511 are more requirements and information regarding modern\n   software development methods. This is also in accordance with\n   preliminary work performed by the current IEC 61508-3 maintenance\n   committee.}","ISSN":"{0149-144X}","ISBN":"{978-1-5090-0249-8}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000383954600115}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000383845100036","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Valter, Narcisa and Androniceanu, Armenia and Dragulanescu,\n   Irina-Virginia and Duca, Mioara","Editor":"{Pamfilie, R and Dinu, V and Tachiciu, L and Plesea, D and Vasiliu, C}","Title":"{AGILE MANAGEMENT BASED ON MODULARIZATION OF PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES}","Booktitle":"{BASIQ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE: NEW TRENDS IN SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS AND\n   CONSUMPTION 2016}","Series":"{Proceedings of BASIQ}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{310-318}","Note":"{Basiq International Conference - New Trends in Sustainable Business and\n   Consumption, Konstanz, GERMANY, JUN 02-03, 2016}","Organization":"{Allensbach Univ; AE}","Abstract":"{Currently, to withstand on the market and especially to make profits,\n   companies must be able to modify their production strategies in order to\n   respond quickly, with quality products at minimal costs.

They are becoming more and more\n   ``software-based.{''} The use of Network Function Virtualization (NFV)\n   to run network services in software enables Software Defined Networks\n   (SDN) to create a largely software-based network. To truly achieve the\n   vision of a high-performance software-based network that is flexible,\n   lower-cost, and agile, a fast and carefully designed network function\n   virtualization platform along with a comprehensive SDN control plane is\n   needed.\n   Our high-performance NFV platform, OpenNetVM, enables high bandwidth\n   network functions to operate at near line speed, while taking advantage\n   of the flexibility and customization of low cost commodity servers.\n   OpenNetVM exploits Intel's DPDK libraries to minimize the overhead of\n   packet processing, and to provide high throughput, low latency\n   networking in virtualized environments. OpenNetVM allows true zero-copy\n   delivery of data to VMs, both for packet processing and highspeed\n   inter-VM communication through shared huge pages within a trust\n   boundary. We envision a dynamic and flexible network that can support a\n   smarter data plane than just simple switches that forward packets. We\n   build on our OpenNetVM NFV platform by developing our SDNFV network\n   architecture that supports complex stateful routing of flows where\n   processing by network functions (NFs) can dynamically modify the path\n   taken by flows, without unduly burdening the centralized SDN controller.\n   The tutorial will also briefly touch upon the problem of dynamic\n   placement of network functions and routing of flows through a software\n   based network, exploiting a mixture of centralized SDN control and NFV\n   capabilities in the network. The problem can be formulated as a mixed\n   integer linear programming problem, and heuristics can be used to solve\n   the problem incrementally.\n   As a case study, we examine the growing communication needs of\n   `Internet-of-Things' (IoT). With `smart' sensing devices becoming\n   ubiquitous, there is a need to support IoT communication at large scale,\n   especially over cellular networks. The use of NFV platforms for the\n   Evolved Packet Core, we see opportunities for supporting IoT\n   communications at large scale in 5G cellular networks. We will describe\n   potential solutions in this direction.}","DOI":"{10.1109/ICDCS.2016.112}","ISSN":"{1063-6927}","ISBN":"{978-1-5090-1482-8}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000383224500004}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000383741200016","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Ghobadi, Monia and Mahajan, Ratul and Phanishayee, Amar and Devanur,\n   Nikhil and Kulkarni, Janardhan and Ranade, Gireeja and Blanche,\n   Pierre-Alexandre and Rastegarfar, Houman and Glick, Madeleine and\n   Kilper, Daniel","Book-Group-Author":"{ACM}","Title":"{ProjecToR: Agile Reconfigurable Data Center Interconnect}","Booktitle":"{PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 ACM CONFERENCE ON SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP ON DATA\n   COMMUNICATION (SIGCOMM `16)}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{216-229}","Note":"{ACM Conference on Special Interest Group on Data Communication\n   (SIGCOMM), Florianopolis, BRAZIL, AUG 22-26, 2016}","Organization":"{Assoc Comp Machinery; ACM SIGCOMM}","Abstract":"{We explore a novel, free-space optics based approach for building data\n   center interconnects.

An ASC is a dynamic alliance of member\n   enterprises, the adaptation of which is likely to introduce velocity,\n   responsiveness and flexibility into the manufacturing system. In ASC\n   management, supplier/partner selection is a key strategic concern;\n   influenced by various agility-related criteria/attributes. Therefore,\n   evaluation and selection of potential supplier in an ASC has become an\n   important multi-criteria decision-making problem. The purpose of this\n   paper is to report, a supplier selection procedure (module) in the\n   context of ASC.\n   Design/methodology/approach - During supplier selection, subjectivity of\n   evaluation information (human judgment) often creates conflict and bears\n   some kind of uncertainty. To overcome this, the present work attempts to\n   explore vague set theory to deal with uncertainties in the supplier\n   selection decision-making process. Since, vague sets can provide more\n   accurate information as compared to fuzzy sets. It considers true\n   membership function as well as false membership function which give more\n   superior results for uncertain information. In this procedure, first,\n   linguistic variables have been used to assess appropriateness rating\n   (performance extent) as well as priority weights for individual\n   quantitative or qualitative criterions. Second, the concept of degree of\n   similarity and probability of vague sets has been used to determine\n   appropriate ranking order of the potential supplier alternatives.\n   Findings - A case empirical example has been provided. It has been\n   proved that the methodology would be fruitful in considering different\n   evaluation criterion (indices); may be contradicting in nature like\n   beneficial and cost criterions. The application of vague set theory has\n   also been proved as a better option to work under uncertain (fuzzy)\n   decision-making environment in comparison to fuzzy set theory.\n   Originality/value - The application of vague set theory in\n   multi-criteria group decision making has been reported in literature to\n   a limited extent. Application of vague set as a decision-making tool in\n   agile supplier selection appears relative new and unexplored work area.\n   The work has got remarkable managerial implications.}","DOI":"{10.1108/BIJ-03-2014-0020}","ISSN":"{1463-5771}","EISSN":"{1758-4094}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000382537300006}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382670000006","entryType":"incollection","entryTags":{"Author":"Christopher, Martin and Harrison, Alan and van Hoek, Remko","Editor":"{Pawar, KS and Rogers, H and Potter, A and Naim, M}","Title":"{Creating the Agile Supply Chain: Issues and Challenges}","Booktitle":"{DEVELOPMENTS IN LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT: PAST, PRESENT AND\n   FUTURE}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{61-68}","ISBN":"{978-1-137-54125-3; 978-1-137-54123-9}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000382670000006}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382670000007","entryType":"incollection","entryTags":{"Author":"Pearson, Michael and Masson, Ron and Swain, Anthony","Editor":"{Pawar, KS and Rogers, H and Potter, A and Naim, M}","Title":"{Process Control in Agile Supply Chain Networks}","Booktitle":"{DEVELOPMENTS IN LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT: PAST, PRESENT AND\n   FUTURE}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{69-79}","ISBN":"{978-1-137-54125-3; 978-1-137-54123-9}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000382670000007}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382224200002","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Wang, Yang and Wagner, Stefan","Book-Group-Author":"{ACM}","Title":"{Towards Applying a Safety Analysis and Verification Method based on STPA\n   to Agile Software Development}","Booktitle":"{INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CONTINUOUS SOFTWARE EVOLUTION AND DELIVERY,\n   CSED 2016}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{5-11}","Note":"{1st International Workshop on Continuous Software Evolution and Delivery\n   (CSED), Austin, TX, MAY 14-15, 2016}","Organization":"{Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Tech Council Software Engn;\n   ACM Special Interest Grp Software Engn}","Abstract":"{Agile methodologies are becoming widespread in modern software\n   development.

This paper has two\n   main contributions; first, it describes a real world situation, where\n   Kanban is applied to a FOSS project, and second, it suggests two new\n   Kanban practices. These two methods are targeted specifically at FOSS\n   projects and their characteristics.}","DOI":"{10.1007/978-3-319-39225-7\\_6}","ISSN":"{1868-4238}","ISBN":"{978-3-319-39225-7; 978-3-319-39224-0}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000383203700006}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000383245200018","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Wang, Lei and Liu, Qiang and Chen, Xin","Editor":"{Qi, E and Shen, J and Dou, R}","Title":"{Intelligent Manufacturing Based on Cloud-Integrated Manufacturing CPS}","Booktitle":"{PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL\n   ENGINEERING AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT: CORE THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF\n   INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING (VOL 1)}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{177-186}","Note":"{IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering\n   Management (IEEM), Singapore, SINGAPORE, DEC 06-09, 2015}","Organization":"{IEEE Singapore Section; IEEE TEMS Singapore Chapter; IEEE TEMS Hong Kong\n   Chapter; CMES, Chinese Ind Engn Inst; Guangdong Univ Technol}","Abstract":"{In this paper, we propose a new agile automation system based on a\n   Cloud-integrated Manufacturing Cyber-Physical System (CIMCPS).

It has become so important that organizations have begun to\n   directly manage the supply chain, appointing specific managers to\n   perform this function. New challenges now include a focus on supply to\n   determine the right time and place for product delivery. Some authors\n   indicate a close relationship between Total Quality Management and the\n   supply chain regarding its philosophical and operational goals and\n   perspectives. Lee (2004) goes even further by indicating that only\n   organizations that devise agile, adaptable and aligned supply chains\n   will be able to continue competing in today's environment. Therefore,\n   observing and measuring the supply chain at all times is critical for\n   today's organizations.

VSM occupies the top level in the\n   ISM hierarchy, indicating that all other Lean enablers should act in\n   unison to make VSM implementation a success.\n   Originality/value - Enablers are the building blocks for deployment of\n   the Lean concept. To know the key enablers and relationship among them\n   can help many organizations to develop Lean competencies. This study is\n   perhaps among the first few that focuses on two modeling procedures\n   based on interpretive logic, i.e. ISM and IRP. The paper provides useful\n   insights to the Lean production implementers, consultants and\n   researchers.}","DOI":"{10.1108/JM2-05-2014-0040}","ISSN":"{1746-5664}","EISSN":"{1746-5672}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000381439800003}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382503800025","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Adler, Eric and Dietlein, Charles and Hedden, Abigail and Martone,\n   Anthony and Mitchell, Gregory and Zaghloul, Amir and Ranney, Kenneth and\n   Dogaru, Traian and Gallagher, Kyle and Govoni, Mark A.","Editor":"{Ranney, KI and Doerry, A}","Title":"{Trends in Radar, a US Army Research Laboratory Perspective}","Booktitle":"{RADAR SENSOR TECHNOLOGY XX}","Series":"{Proceedings of SPIE}","Year":"{2016}","Volume":"{9829}","Note":"{Conference on Radar Sensor Technology XX, Baltimore, MD, APR 18-21, 2016}","Organization":"{SPIE}","Abstract":"{Today's military radars are being challenged to satisfy multiple mission\n   requirements and operate in complex, dynamic electromagnetic (EM)\n   environments.

To achieve RCM, efficient impact\n   analysis is mandatory. A common repository is a good approach to\n   maintain changed requirements, reusing and reducing effort. Thus, a\n   better approach is needed to tailor knowledge for better change\n   management of requirements and architecture during global software\n   development (GSD). The objective of this research is to introduce an\n   innovative approach for handling requirements and architecture changes\n   simultaneously during global software development. The approach makes\n   use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and agile practices. Agile practices\n   make our approach iterative, whereas CBR stores requirements and makes\n   them reusable. Twin Peaks is our base model, meaning that requirements\n   and architecture are handled simultaneously. For this research, grounded\n   theory has been applied; similarly, interviews from domain experts were\n   conducted. Interview and literature transcripts formed the basis of data\n   collection in grounded theory. Physical saturation of theory has been\n   achieved through a published case study and developed tool.

These difficulties are compounded further\n   in the case of cross-border emergencies, which often require the\n   coordination and collaboration of independent agencies. These agencies\n   have different structures and resources in place, and follow their own\n   internal policies and procedures. If a number of countries have been\n   affected, agencies may not even share the same language. Large-scale\n   disasters, whether natural, deliberate, or accidental do not respect\n   borders and come with a high risk to human life and a variety of\n   economic and health impacts. Thus, it is the aim of the S-HELP\n   (Securing-Health Emergency Learning Planning) project to develop a\n   decision support tool-set that supports multi-agency decision-making\n   during cross-border emergencies. S-HELP seeks to provide a tool-set that\n   supports rapid and effective decision-making across all stages of the\n   emergency management lifecycle (i.e. mitigation, preparedness, response,\n   and recovery). To address the challenges associated with multi-agency\n   emergency management, a holistic framed approach to healthcare\n   preparedness, response, and recovery is proposed. This holistic\n   framework has been created to guide the development of the S-HELP\n   solution. The framework integrates a number of components important in\n   the phased iterative development of an emergency management decision\n   support system, such as, interoperability standards, risk communication,\n   spatial data management, agile development, healthcare responder\n   training, and scenario development for system evaluation.}","DOI":"{10.1080/12460125.2016.1187393}","ISSN":"{1166-8636}","EISSN":"{2116-7052}","ORCID-Numbers":"{Nussbaumer, Alexander/0000-0002-4692-5741}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000378231800029}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000378231800032","entryType":"article","entryTags":{"Author":"Organ, Damien and O'Flaherty, Brian","Title":"{Intuitive decision-making and deep level diversity in entrepreneurial\n   ICT teams}","Journal":"{JOURNAL OF DECISION SYSTEMS}","Year":"{2016}","Volume":"{25}","Number":"{1, SI}","Pages":"{421-435}","Abstract":"{Intuition, which ranges in style from affective to inferential to\n   holistic (Pretz et al. 2014) can play a central role in decision-making,\n   as decision makers must often balance intuition with rational analytical\n   thinking. This paper explores the influence of intuition based decision\n   style diversity on both the emergence of transactive memory systems\n   (TMS) and team performance in an entrepreneurial setting. The\n   uncertainty of an entrepreneurial setting leads to a greater emphasis on\n   intuitive thinking in the team context. However, intuition as a basis\n   for decision-making manifests itself in a variety of forms. And not all\n   forms of intuitive tendencies lend themselves to a team decision-making\n   context that is cohesive, or to decisions that are strategically\n   coherent. Given that a diversity of intuitive tendencies is likely to be\n   found in every team setting, and as such may exert a considerable\n   influence on the decision-making process, we develop hypotheses in order\n   to investigate the nature of this influence. Drawing on data collected\n   from 188 participants across 22 countries and split into 48\n   entrepreneurial ICT teams, our findings show strong support for the\n   influence of intuitive decision style diversity on both team level\n   states and team performance.

An international MBDA team has been\n   set up to identify commonalities in any command and control application\n   within the air defence scope. This work led to an open architecture that\n   encapsulates elements that depend on weapon system specificities by the\n   ones that are common. The common elements, covering surveillance, threat\n   evaluation, weapon assignment and engagement control functions within\n   the wide MBDA's set of effectors, have been developed using MBDA\n   Internal Research Funding and now are used to build up next-generation\n   C2 solutions.

Traditional architecture development is based on three\n   architectural phases: architectural analysis, architectural synthesis\n   and architectural evaluation. The highly ceremonial character of the\n   traditional process is also reflected in the role of the software\n   architect, who is responsible for generating numerous architectural\n   artefacts.\n   The proponents of agile development start from the position that an\n   architecture emerges gradually, after every iteration, as a result of\n   continuous code refactoring, rather than from a previously built\n   structure.

First, the matching method for a CPS-fed\n   strip loop antenna to operate at its fundamental mode, i.e.,\n   half-wavelength resonance, is discussed.

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new\n   way to Design, Build and Operate Networks.

The main idea is to decouple the control and data\n   planes, allowing the network to be programmatically controlled. A key\n   element of SDN architectures is the controller. This logically\n   centralized entity acts as a network operating system, providing\n   applications with a uniform and centralized programming interface to the\n   underlying network.

The main problem with traditional\n   firewall is that Network Administrator cannot modify/extend the\n   capabilities of traditional vendor-specific firewall. Network\n   Administrator can only configure the firewall according to the\n   specifications given by the firewall vendor.

There is a wide spectrum\n   in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices\n   conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is\n   important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software\n   engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their\n   companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners\n   developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software\n   size measurement approaches more, or use different software development\n   methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other\n   sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in\n   small versus large companies?\n   Objective: Our objective is to get an understanding into the\n   cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices\n   versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects\n   (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding\n   will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which\n   should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific\n   demographic (e.g., small versus large companies). Thus, we decided to\n   conduct an exploratory study in this area and collected real industrial\n   data in the context of Turkey which has a vibrant software industry.\n   Method: To achieve the above objective, we use the data from a recent\n   Turkish-wide survey of software engineering practices which was\n   systematically designed with 46 questions based on our past experience\n   in the Canadian context and using the Software Engineering Body of\n   Knowledge (SWEBOK). 202 practicing software engineers participated in\n   the survey. We raise a set of 12 research questions about the\n   cross-factor correlation of software engineering practices and\n   practitioner demographics, and address them using statistical analysis.\n   Results: The exploratory study results reveal important and interesting\n   findings about cross-factor relationship of software engineering\n   practices and practitioner demographics. Among some of the most\n   interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we\n   were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of\n   work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more\n   challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and SE\n   tasks; (2) Almost 55\\% of participants measure software size; (3)\n   Agile/lean development is used the least (16\\%) by the participants\n   working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4)\n   Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small sized\n   companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among\n   this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of\n   spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme\n   programming practices decreases.\n   Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study will be useful to\n   software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and\n   world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software\n   engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises\n   several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many\n   practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how\n   these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more\n   frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and\n   challenging experiences in using SE tools?, and (3) Why is Agile lean\n   development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how\n   these approaches could be utilized more frequently.

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum\n   concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering\n   for students' individual learning characteristics. To address this\n   issue, learning styles become effective to understand students'\n   different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis\n   claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the\n   students' learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails\n   to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of\n   software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing\n   hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder-Silverman\n   Learning Style Model in a Scrum course.

A specific domain where FBMC offers\n   a clear advantage over other multicarrier solutions is the efficient\n   occupancy of underutilized and fragmented spectrum. This is due to the\n   rich spectral containment of the FBMC technology, which guarantees\n   superior interference protection to the primary coexisting\n   transmissions. These features of FBMC could play an important role in\n   the economic delivery of 5G services in licensed and unlicensed bands.\n   This article focuses on the public safety domain where existing\n   professional mobile radio (PMR) users plan to add broadband services at\n   the 400 MHz band, aiming to occupy the spectral holes left by current\n   narrowband transmissions. In this respect an agile SDR broadband\n   downlink FBMC system, aimed at exploiting unused licensed PMR spectrum,\n   was developed and experimentally validated. The FBMC frame structure\n   shared key similarities with the LTE specification. Two different SDR\n   design methodologies were used to build the real-time baseband\n   prototype. The level of interference protection offered by a broadband\n   FBMC system to a coexisting primary narrowband PMR transmission was\n   practically demonstrated and compared to that of an equivalent LTE\n   system.

Ideally, suppliers would like to know the order quantities\n   with enough lead-time to set up the production process and schedule for\n   delivery. However, retailers cannot predict demand accurately and thus\n   both suppliers and retailers may incur significant losses due to\n   under-stocking and/or over-stocking. To attenuate this effect, one of\n   the viable practices is that suppliers impose minimum Order Quantity\n   Commitments (OQC) for regular orders and penalties for reduced orders,\n   while providing retailers with expedited-delivery options at premium\n   costs if needs arise. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to\n   assist in developing inventory management policies to optimize the\n   expected profit. Our model considers a two-period setting where\n   retailers place orders according to pre-sale forecasts but then have the\n   opportunity to update their orders just prior to the season according to\n   the most recent forecasts and the current inventory level. Utilizing the\n   newsvendor model and dynamic programming methods, we obtain the optimal\n   ordering and replenishing policies that maximize the expected profits of\n   retailers. We then analyze the impacts of these flexible terms on the\n   performance of both the retailer and the supplier. (C) 2015 Elsevier\n   B.V.

Method: The\n   method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies\n   published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been\n   identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches.

Conclusion: Most of agile\n   methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were\n   implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated\n   their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for\n   tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main\n   criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables.

There is a need to model\n   agile enterprise architecture artefacts both at the high and low\n   detailed level for a particular context. ArchiMate is relatively a new\n   high-level architecture modelling standard. There is a growing interest\n   amongst organisations in applying ArchiMate for high-level agile\n   enterprise architecture modelling.

These tasks are created as refinements of\n   product backlog items at the beginning of each sprint. However, a\n   project team's understanding of the backlog items' business implications\n   and dependencies may often not be deep enough to identify all necessary\n   tasks this early, so in addition to the tasks defined in the beginning\n   of the sprint, more necessary tasks might be discovered as the sprint\n   progresses, making any attempt at progress estimation or risk management\n   difficult.\n   Objective: We strive to enable software teams to achieve a deeper\n   understanding of product backlog items, which should help them to\n   identify a sprint's tasks more reliably and comprehensively, and avoid\n   discovering the need for extra tasks during sprint execution.\n   Method: We introduced a project team in a medium-sized software\n   development company to the Interaction Room method, which encourages\n   interdisciplinary communication about key system design aspects among\n   all stakeholders. We observed the team's conduct in the sprint planning\n   meetings, and tracked early- vs. late-identified tasks across several\n   sprints.\n   Results: Before the introduction of our method, the team used to\n   discover on average 26\\% of a sprint's tasks not at the beginning of the\n   sprint, but later during the course of the sprint. Using the Interaction\n   Room in two separate projects, this ratio dropped to an average of 5\\%\n   late-discovered tasks.\n   Conclusion: Our observations from these projects suggest that increased\n   communication among all stakeholders of a project leads to a more\n   reliable identification of the tasks to be performed in a sprint, and\n   that an Interaction Room can provide appropriate guidance to conduct\n   this team communication in a focused and pragmatic way.

Communication and\n   knowledge transfer are becoming even bigger challenges with the current\n   increase in globally distributed software development projects due to\n   the temporal, geographic, and sociocultural diversity among software\n   stakeholders. In this study, we propose a new approach to requirements\n   elicitation, which employs online serious games for gathering\n   requirements from distributed software stakeholders.

However, crowdsourcing applications in the\n   fields of design research and creative innovation have been much slower\n   to emerge. So, although there have been reports of systems and\n   researchers using Internet crowdsourcing to carry out generative design,\n   there are still many gaps in knowledge about the capability and\n   limitations of the technology. Indeed the process models developed to\n   support traditional commercial design (e.g. Pugh's Total Design, Agile,\n   Double-Diamond etc.) have yet to be established for Crowdsourced Design\n   (cDesign).

Our objective\n   is to characterize and grasp a high-level view on type of SE practices\n   in the Turkish software industry. To achieve this objective, we\n   systematically designed an online survey with 46 questions based on our\n   past experience in the Canadian and Turkish contexts and using the\n   Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Two hundred and two\n   practicing software engineers from the Turkish software industry\n   participated in the survey. The survey results reveal important and\n   interesting findings about SE practices in Turkey and beyond. They also\n   help track the profession of SE, and suggest areas for improved\n   training, education and research. Among the findings are the followings:\n   (1) The military and defense software sectors are quite prominent in\n   Turkey, especially in the capital Ankara region, and many SE\n   practitioners work for those companies. (2) 54\\% of the participants\n   reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33\\%\n   mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of\n   effort, after the development phase (on average, 31\\% of overall project\n   effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases\n   come next and have similar average values (14\\%, 12\\%, 12\\% and 11\\%\n   respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the\n   requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used\n   lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents\n   (53\\%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and\n   Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38\\% and 34\\%,\n   respectively. (6) The Waterfall and Agile methodologies have slight\n   negative correlations, denoting that if one is used in a company, the\n   other will less likely to be used.

The study of this flow amounts to a\n   specific instance of the hydrodynamics problem for rough tapered\n   cylinder geometries. The outstanding manipulative and locomotor skills\n   of octopuses could inspire the development of advanced robotic arms,\n   able to operate in fluid environments. Our primary aim was to study the\n   hydrodynamic characteristics of such bio-inspired robotic models and to\n   derive the hydrodynamic force coefficients as a concise description of\n   the vortical flow effects. Utilizing computational fluid dynamic\n   methods, the coefficients were computed on realistic morphologies of\n   octopus-like arm models undergoing prescribed solid-body movements; such\n   motions occur in nature for short durations in time, e.g. during\n   reaching movements and exploratory behaviors.

The results\n   reveal in detail the generation of complex vortical flow structures\n   around the moving arms. Hydrodynamic forces acting on a translating arm\n   depend on the angle of incidence; forces generated during impulsive\n   rotations of the arms are independent of their exact morphology and the\n   angle of rotation; periodic motions based on a slow recovery and a fast\n   power stroke are able to produce considerable propulsive thrust while\n   harmonic motions are not. Parts of these results have been employed in\n   bio-inspired models of underwater robotic mechanisms.

In the model, consumers decide the purchase timing and the\n   firm chooses the inventory level. We find that the loss-averse\n   consumers' strategic purchasing behavior is determined by their\n   perceived gain and loss from strategic purchase delay, and the given\n   rationing risk. Thus, the firm that is cognizant of this property\n   tailors its inventory stocking policy based on the consumers'\n   loss-averse behavior such as their perceived values of gain and loss,\n   and their sensitivity to them. We also demonstrate that the firm's\n   equilibrium inventory stocking policy reflects both the economic logic\n   of the traditional newsvendor inventory model, and the loss-averse\n   behavior of consumers. The equilibrium order quantity is significantly\n   different from those derived from models that assume that the consumers\n   are risk neutral and homogeneous in their valuations. We show that the\n   firm that ignores strategic consumer's loss-aversion behavior tends to\n   keep an unnecessarily high inventory level that leads to excessive\n   leftovers. Our numerical experiments further reveal that in some extreme\n   cases the firm that ignores strategic consumer's loss-aversion behavior\n   generates almost 92\\% more leftovers than the firm that possesses\n   consumers' loss-aversion information and takes it into account when\n   making managerial decisions. To mitigate the consumer's forward-looking\n   behavior, we propose the adoption of the practice of agile supply chain\n   management, which possesses the following attributes: (i) procuring\n   inventory after observing real-time demand information, (ii) enhanced\n   design (which maintains the current production mix but improves the\n   product performance to a higher level), and (iii) customized design\n   (which maintains the current performance level but increases the variety\n   of the current production line to meet consumers' specific demands). We\n   show that such a practice can induce the consumer to make early\n   purchases by increasing their rationing risk, increasing the product\n   value, or diversifying the product line.

The paper, further argues that the IS\n   field seems to more readily engage in a debate of phenomena involving\n   centralised and organisationally-bound technological innovations whereas\n   distributed, decentralised and infrastructural discourses find it much\n   more difficult to gain a foothold.

This type of networks is\n   used in several network applications; such as Local Area Networks (LAN)\n   and Data Center Networks (DCN). In LANs and DCNs, high-speed and\n   short-distance networks are commonly deployed to connect between\n   computing and storage elements in order to provide rapid services.\n   Indeed, the overall performance of such networks is significantly\n   influenced by the Congestion Control Algorithm (CCA) which suffers from\n   the problem of bandwidth under-utilization, especially if the applied\n   buffer regime is very small.

Moreover, Agile-SD shows lower sensitivity to\n   the buffer size change and packet error rate variation which increases\n   its efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

With the advent of mobile users and the\n   increasing power of mobile devices, the spectrum of P2P capabilities\n   should scale. Peers establish transient or persistent relationships with\n   other peers based on mutual interest. Communicating peers may use\n   intermediary peers to forward communication messages, if a direct link\n   is beyond their communication range. A critical design parameter is\n   establishing a resilient communication topology, yet reduce the overhead\n   of control messages required to instill and maintain it. This rises as a\n   significant hindrance in mobile environments, which pose additional\n   challenges on P2P networks due to the heterogeneity of nodes, limited\n   resources, dynamic contexts in addition to the inherited wireless\n   network stringencies. Thus far, efforts in establishing P2P networks via\n   super peers (SPs) have been capped by considering a subset of peer\n   properties to evaluate their candidacy.

We employed social network analysis (SNA) to group\n   practitioners into two clusters, Top Members and Others, based on the\n   numbers of messages they communicated and their engagement in task\n   changes.

Based on an experimental evaluation\n   of the profiler we discuss why the quality of conceptual models can\n   generally benefit from profiling and how performance measurements convey\n   semantic information. Third, we discuss the flow of semantic information\n   when developing and using information systems.\n   Beyond these contributions, we also make a case for using object\n   databases in agile development environments. However, most of the\n   presented concepts are also applicable to other database paradigms. (C)\n   2015 Elsevier B.V.

A critical challenge in\n   deploying PMU-based RTSE applications at large scale is the lack of a\n   scalable and flexible communication infrastructure for the timely (i.e.,\n   sub-second) delivery of the high volume of synchronized and continuous\n   synchrophasor measurements. We address this challenge by introducing a\n   communication platform called C-DAX based on the information-centric\n   networking (ICN) concept. With a topic-based publish-subscribe engine\n   that decouples data producers and consumers in time and space, C-DAX\n   enables efficient synchrophasor measurement delivery, as well as\n   flexible and scalable (re) configuration of PMU data communication for\n   seamless full observability of power conditions in complex and dynamic\n   scenarios. Based on the derived set of requirements for supporting\n   PMU-based RTSE in ADNs, we design the ICN-based C-DAX communication\n   platform, together with a joint optimized physical network resource\n   provisioning strategy, in order to enable the agile PMU data\n   communications in near real-time.

This leap, however, adds complexity to optimizing\n   transmission. Not only does the appropriate data rate need to be\n   selected, but also the MIMO transmission technique (e.g., Spatial\n   Diversity or Spatial Multiplexing), the number of streams, and the\n   channel width. Incorporating these features into a rate adaptation (RA)\n   solution requires a new set of rules to accurately evaluate channel\n   conditions and select the appropriate transmission setting with minimal\n   overhead. To address these challenges, our contributions in this work\n   are two-fold. First, we propose a practical link metric that accurately\n   captures channel conditions in MIMO 802.11n environments, and we call\n   this metric diffSNR. Using diffSNR captured from real testbed\n   environments, we build performance models that accuractely predict link\n   quality in 95.5\\% of test cases. Practicality and deployability are\n   guaranteed with diffSNR as it can be measured on all off-the-shelf MIMO\n   WiFi chipsets. Second, we propose ARAMIS (Agile Rate Adaptation for MIMO\n   Systems), a standard-compliant, closed-loop RA solution that jointly\n   adapts rate and bandwidth, and we utilize the diffSNR-based 802.11n\n   performance models within ARAMIS's framework. ARAMIS adapts transmission\n   rates on a per-packet basis; we believe it is the first closed-loop,\n   802.11 RA algorithm that simultaneously adapts rate and channel width.\n   We have implemented ARAMIS with diffSNR on Atheros-based devices and\n   deployed it on our 15-node testbed. Our experiments show that ARAMIS\n   accurately adapts to a wide variety of channel conditions with\n   negligible overhead. Furthermore, ARAMIS outperforms existing RA\n   algorithms in 802.11n environments with up to a 10-fold increase in\n   throughput. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

WiSARD (Wilkie,\n   Stonham and Aleksander's Recognition Device), a weightless artificial\n   neural network architecture that proved to be both robust and efficient\n   in classification tasks, has been previously used in order to turn the\n   training phase faster. WiSARD is a RAM-based system that requires only\n   one memory writing operation to train each sentence. Additionally, the\n   mechanism is capable of learning new tagged sentences during the\n   classification phase, on an incremental basis. Nevertheless, parameters\n   such as RAM size, context window, and probability bit mapping, make the\n   multilingual part-of-speech tagging task hard. This article proposes\n   mWANN-Tagger (multilingual Weightless Artificial Neural Network tagger),\n   a WiSARD PUS-tagger. This tagger is proposed due to its one-pass\n   learning capability. It allows language-specific parameter\n   configurations to be thoroughly searched in quite an agile fashion.\n   Experimental evaluation indicates that mWANN-Tagger either outperforms\n   or matches state-of-art methods in accuracy with very low standard\n   deviation, i.e., lower than 0.25\\%. Experimental results also suggest\n   that the vast majority of the languages can benefit from this\n   architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing planning methods all suggest that research\n   and analysis should be the first phase, followed by strategy, smart\n   goals and a detailed action plan, and ending with an evaluation of the\n   results. These models provide an undesirable illusion of control. That\n   is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in\n   which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing\n   constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders.\n   Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more\n   complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant\n   publics implicates. That is why preference should be given to the view\n   that communication is not so much communication between two or more\n   actors but is a multi-way diachronic process of ongoing constructions of\n   meanings in which one cannot foresee who is - or will be - involved, in\n   what way, and what the results will be. To be successful, a more\n   flexible planning method is needed in which change is a defining part\n   during the process. Scrum is such a method. To make it applicable in\n   public relations, this agile method, well-known in IT, needed to be\n   expanded by supplementing theory on communication, change and\n   reflectivity, and by enrichment of the common notion of evaluation.

Today,\n   unfortunately, this capability does not exist. Why? Because most\n   suppliers use proprietary information models to represent and share\n   their MSC information! This limits both the semantic precision in the\n   models, which is needed for interoperability, and the level of agility\n   in the supply chains. The availability of a semantically precise and\n   rich reference MSC ontology could address both of these limitations.\n   Based on our prior research, the development of such an ontology will\n   require a semantic mediation process between the proprietary MSC models\n   and the reference MSC ontology. At the heart of every known,\n   semantic-mediation process is a mapping between a proprietary MSC model\n   and the reference MSC ontology. Such a mapping must deal with the\n   structural and semantic conflicts between the two. In this paper, we\n   propose a new approach, which we call canonicalization to address the\n   structural conflicts. The semantic conflicts are addressed using logical\n   mapping. The canonicalization pre-processes the structural\n   representations of the proprietary models and then aligns them using\n   ontology design patterns which are also used in the reference ontology.\n   This simplifies both the mapping problems themselves and the resulting\n   mapping statements considerably. In the paper, we also demonstrate our\n   approach and its benefits in the context of a description-logic-based\n   semantic mediation using the Ontology Web Language (OWL).

The\n   research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software\n   development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team\n   members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to\n   navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions.\n   Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was\n   evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a\n   large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the\n   feasibility of composing processes for three software development\n   projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing\n   (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search\n   (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing\n   the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to\n   verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her\n   expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable\n   sequence of components.\n   Findings: The main findings indicate that GA is more effective (best\n   results regarding the fitness function) than HC and RS in the search of\n   solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition\n   for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small\n   instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a\n   context. These SBSE results were complemented by the feedback given by\n   specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity,\n   adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager\n   during the decision making in process composition.\n   Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single\n   company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality\n   restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed\n   to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample\n   prevents generalization for other types of projects or different\n   contexts.\n   Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are\n   facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition,\n   since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process\n   composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by\n   presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes\n   both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through\n   software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the\n   standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions\n   in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile,\n   and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase\n   collaboration in software development.\n   Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage\n   collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it\n   brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on\n   the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area.

Applying techniques of\n   spectrum sharing in CR networks can achieve the efficient utilization of\n   network resources. Usually, data rates of user sessions are time varied\n   because of the dynamic behaviors of CR networks. It is expected that the\n   occurrence of link outage should be avoided and incorporated into the\n   routing design under conditions of increasingly crowded spectrum. This\n   paper proposes an integral framework, which considers these two\n   correlated schemes (resource reconfiguration and robust routing)\n   simultaneously. For that, the resource reconfiguration scheme is\n   developed for the efficient usage of network resources and aims at\n   reducing the occupancy of licensed bands.

This not only holds for processes\n   running within a single enterprise, but also for collaborative scenarios\n   involving distributed and autonomous partners. In particular, if one\n   partner adapts its private process, the change might affect the\n   processes of the other partners as well. Accordingly, it might have to\n   be propagated to concerned partners in a transitive way. A fundamental\n   challenge in this context is to find ways of propagating the changes in\n   a decentralized manner. Existing approaches are limited with respect to\n   the change operations considered as well as their dependency on a\n   particular process specification language.

Coping with frequent unexpected\n   events requires an organizational culture that allows the project\n   manager to exercise a great amount of flexibility.\n   The traditional approach to project management emphasizes that project\n   success depends on stability. According to this approach, project\n   success can be achieved by focusing on planning and on controlling and\n   managing risks. Although the popularity of this approach has sharply\n   increased across industries, research covering a wide variety of\n   projects consistently reveals poor performance.\n   The authors collected data from more than 150 successful project\n   managers affiliated with more than 20 organizations and concluded that\n   today's successful project managers cope with unexpected events by a\n   combination of traditional and ``agile{''} approaches to project\n   management. Using business examples drawn from their research at\n   organizations such as Procter \\& Gamble, NASA and the construction\n   services company Boldt, the authors identified four key roles that\n   successful project managers play:\n   The first role, developing collaboration, is performed early on during\n   the project.\n   The second role, integrating planning and review with learning, is\n   performed periodically throughout the project.\n   The third role, preventing major disruptions, is performed occasionally.\n   The fourth role, maintaining forward momentum, is performed\n   continuously.\n   Today's managers must be people-oriented, information-oriented and\n   action-oriented.

In\n   this article, the authors discuss the pressures on companies to disclose\n   supply chain information, the drivers and impediments to such\n   disclosure, and the types of supply chain information typically made\n   available to the public. The article identifies the broad disclosure\n   strategies companies can use to release supply chain information and\n   offers managers guidance on designing the optimal disclosure strategy\n   for their company.

Aside from internal governance\n   and risk concerns, external pressure has come from government\n   regulations, best practices of peers, changing expectations from salient\n   stakeholder groups, and, of course, external events (such as the 2013\n   Rana Plaza garment factory collapse in Bangladesh).\n   The authors note that improving transparency can be expensive. The lack\n   of standardized reporting systems, the absence of a common technology\n   platform, ill-defined standards, and a lack of supplier education can\n   also pose serious hindrances to companies wishing to improve their\n   supply chain transparency.\n   The authors identify four common types of supply chain information that\n   tends to be publicly disclosed: supply chain membership, provenance of\n   materials, environmental information, and information on social impacts\n   such as working conditions. Based on their research, they developed a\n   transparency matrix to frame four typical supply chain disclosure\n   strategies: transparent, secret, distracting, and withheld.

A key design\n   criterion in network design is the ability to recover from failures in\n   an agile and efficient manner. Protection capabilities are highly\n   required in optical networks since the failure of an optical link might\n   potentially lead to a significant traffic loss. Under this context,\n   Network Coding Protection (NCP) has emerged as an innovative solution to\n   proactively enable protection in an agile and efficient manner by means\n   of throughput improvement techniques such as Network Coding (NC).\n   Nevertheless, the benefits of NC can be reduced by the negative effects\n   of inaccurate Network State Information (NSI), which are common in\n   dynamic scenarios.\n   In this paper, we propose a novel proactive protection strategy based on\n   NC jointly with a Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture called\n   Predictive Network Coding Protection (PNCP). PNCP leverages predictive\n   techniques in order to mitigate the negative impact of the inaccurate\n   NSI on the blocking probability. In addition, PNCP computes resilient\n   lightpaths with a low amount of network resources devoted for path\n   protection.\n   By means of extensive simulation results we show that in comparison with\n   proactive protection strategies such as Dedicated Path Protection (DPP),\n   and conventional dynamic NCP, PNCP reduces the blocking probability as\n   well as the network resources allocated for path protection in dynamic\n   scenarios.

It relies on the analysis of an original, qualitative study\n   of agile software development teams, which operate in an environment\n   characterized by the simultaneous implementation of interdependent\n   organizational routines. We argue that the interdependencies among\n   routines are seized by organizational members who manipulate the level\n   of `protection' that each routine is granted (i.e. the enforcement of\n   adherence to the routine). Less protection permits flexibility, whereas\n   more protection creates stability. We observe that `protection' can be\n   exerted along two different, yet related, dimensions: content of the\n   routine and performance of the routine. The interplay of these two\n   dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can\n   vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or\n   their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and\n   flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling\n   the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their\n   protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility.

We show that client-side buffered\n   video time is a good feedback signal to guide video adaptation. We then\n   propose novel video rate control algorithms that balance the needs for\n   video rate smoothness and high bandwidth utilization. We show that a\n   small video rate margin can lead to much improved smoothness in video\n   rate and buffer size. We also propose HAS designs that can work with\n   multiple servers and wireless connections. We develop a fully functional\n   HAS system and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments on\n   a network testbed and the Internet. We demonstrate that our HAS designs\n   are highly efficient and robust in realistic network environment.}","DOI":"{10.1109/TNET.2015.2464700}","ISSN":"{1063-6692}","EISSN":"{1558-2566}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000382358700034}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000381456200006","entryType":"article","entryTags":{"Author":"Rodriguez, Guillermo and Soria, Alvaro and Campo, Marcelo","Title":"{Measuring the Impact of Agile Coaching on Students' Performance}","Journal":"{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION}","Year":"{2016}","Volume":"{59}","Number":"{3}","Pages":"{202-209}","Month":"{AUG}","Abstract":"{Nowadays, considerable attention is paid to agile methods as a means to\n   improve management of software development processes.

This paper\n   extends the common underlay sharing model by incorporating the\n   interference originating from the incumbent system into generic combined\n   beamforming design that can be applied on interference, broadcast, or\n   multiple access channels. This paper proposes two novel multiuser\n   beamforming algorithms for user fairness and sum rate maximization,\n   utilizing newly derived convex optimization problems for transmit and\n   receive beamformers calculation in a recursive optimization.

In particular, Scrum is an agile process\n   framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the\n   practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text\n   book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum\n   practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well\n   motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum\n   for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the\n   deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially\n   harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data\n   collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11\n   companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three\n   different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns.\n   The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the\n   deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum,\n   and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where\n   available, we have included company recommendations regarding the\n   deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based\n   on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum\n   concepts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our research hypothesis is that\n   modifications to agile software development based on inspirations from\n   mission command can improve the software engineering process in terms of\n   planning, prioritizing, and communication of software requirements and\n   progress, as well as improving the overall software product. Targeted\n   Scrum is a modification of Traditional Scrum based on three inspirations\n   from Mission Command: End State, Line of Effort, and Targeting. These\n   inspirations have led to the introduction of the Product Design Meeting\n   and modifications of some current Scrum meetings and artifacts. We\n   tested our research hypothesis using a semester-long undergraduate level\n   software engineering class. Students developed two software projects,\n   one using Traditional Scrum and the other using Targeted Scrum. We then\n   assessed how well both methodologies assisted the software development\n   teams in planning and developing the software architecture, prioritizing\n   requirements, and communicating progress. We also evaluated the software\n   product produced by both methodologies. We found that Targeted Scrum did\n   better in assisting the software development teams in the planning and\n   prioritization of the requirements.

These models are parameterized\n   based on channel sounding campaigns in three cities covering radio\n   frequencies ranging from 0.8 to 60 GHz. Fitting the models with measured\n   pathloss reveals that the models are usable to cover the considered\n   frequency range. The FI and FR models are equally simple and robust,\n   with a slight advantage of the FI model in accuracy because of the\n   larger number of model parameters. The original M. 2135 LOSmodel is\n   based on a two-ray model that includes a break point (BP). The model is\n   extended for a better fit with measurements by including new model\n   parameters such as a pathloss offset and a BP scaling factor that\n   represent local scattering conditions of surrounding environments. The\n   new model parameters are found frequency dependent in many cases. The\n   original M. 2135 model is furthermore simplified in NLOS scenarios while\n   maintaining the model accuracy. The model parameters are derived using\n   maximum likelihood estimation, which also showed that the modified M.\n   2135 model offers up to 50\\% better accuracy compared to the FI and FR\n   models in terms of the employed log-likelihood function (LLF).

A grounded theory study with 12 software\n   teams in three companies in Malaysia, Norway, Poland and the United\n   Kingdom was conducted. We interviewed 60 people, observed 79 daily\n   stand-up meetings and collected supplementary data. The factors that\n   contributed the most to a positive attitude towards the daily stand-up\n   meeting were information sharing with the team and the opportunity to\n   discuss and solve problems. The factors that contributed the most to a\n   negative attitude were status reporting to the manager and that the\n   frequency of the meeting was perceived to be too high and the duration\n   too long. Based on our results, we developed a grounded theory of daily\n   standup meetings and proposed empirically based recommendations and\n   guidelines on how to organize them. Organizations should be aware of the\n   factors that may affect the attitude towards daily stand-up meetings and\n   should consider our recommendations and guidelines to make this agile\n   practice as valuable as possible.

However, many existing cryptographic\n   mechanisms are tightly integrated into communication protocols. Issues\n   emerge when security vulnerabilities are discovered in cryptographic\n   mechanisms because their replacement would eventually require replacing\n   deployed protocols. The concept of cryptographic agility is the solution\n   to these issues because it allows dynamic switching of cryptographic\n   algorithms and keys prior to and during the communication. Most of\n   today's secure protocols implement cryptographic agility (IPsec,\n   SSL/TLS, SSH), but cryptographic agility mechanisms cannot be used in a\n   standalone manner. In order to deal with the aforementioned limitations,\n   we propose a lightweight cryptographically agile agreement model, which\n   is formally verified. We also present a solution in the Agile\n   Cryptographic Agreement Protocol (ACAP) that can be adapted on various\n   network layers, architectures and devices. The proposed solution is able\n   to provide existing and new communication protocols with secure\n   communication prerequisites in a straightforward way without adding\n   substantial communication overhead. Furthermore, it can be used between\n   previously unknown parties in an opportunistic environment.

For cognitive radio applications in\n   particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet\n   suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading\n   to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent\n   OFDM-based standards such as IEEE 802.11p for vehicular communication\n   and IEEE 802.11af for TV whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum\n   emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter\n   masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral\n   efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these\n   strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p\n   and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling\n   cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds\n   baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the\n   specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while\n   allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a\n   single basic channel without violating SEM specifications. The proposed\n   method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict RF filter\n   requirements, allowing the RF subsystem to be implemented using much\n   less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions.

The third subcase concerns the export of\n   frozen mackerel to Japan, and the final subcase concerns seafood trading\n   at a regional wholesale market in Japan. Analysis is based on the view\n   that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a\n   production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are\n   interdependent. The fundamental importance of sequential\n   interdependencies in seafood production is demonstrated. The four\n   subcases are first analysed individually, applying relational\n   contracting theory to understand patterns of exchange leading to\n   transfer of title at markets. Developed relationships and trust, but\n   also an acceptance of partner switching, characterizes exchange in all\n   four market-related subcases. An understanding of how these loosely\n   coupled markets may be viewed as aligned is developed. Markets emerge as\n   nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange\n   facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm\n   is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange\n   facilitate agile seafood distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Every good user\n   story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and\n   testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an\n   understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation\n   of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding\n   the context of a user story.\n   Objective: We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of\n   execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making\n   use of business process models. The method associates user stories with\n   the corresponding business process model activity element.\n   Method: We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define\n   our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed\n   method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates\n   a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process\n   model can be used to infer information about the execution order and\n   integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of\n   association granularity: a user story can be more abstract,\n   approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business\n   process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of\n   these three levels.\n   Results: Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied\n   comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the\n   hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the\n   hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater\n   understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of\n   user stories when associated business process models are available.\n   Conclusions: We addressed a problem which arises from managing user\n   stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing\n   context of a user story.

Existing tools typically only address a specific part\n   of the problem (e.g., control plane verification, flow checker). In this\n   paper, we propose a new approach to tackle SDN fault localization by\n   automatically Modeling via Policy Inference (called MPI) the causality\n   between SDN faults and their symptoms to a belief network. In the MPI\n   system, a service oriented high level policy language is used to specify\n   network services provisioned between end nodes. MPI parses each service\n   provisioning policy to a logical policy view, which consists of a pair\n   of logical end nodes, a traffic pattern specification, and a list of\n   required network functions (or a service function chain). An SDN\n   controller takes the policies from multiple parties and provisions the\n   requested services on its orchestrated SDN network. MPI queries the\n   controller about the network topology and retrieves flow rules from all\n   SDN switches. MPI maps the policy view to the corresponding\n   implementation view, in which all the logical components in the policy\n   view are mapped to the actual system components along with the actual\n   network topology. Referring to the component causality graph templates\n   derived from SDN reference model, the implementation view of the current\n   running network services can be modeled as a belief network. A heuristic\n   fault reasoning algorithm is adopted to search for the most likely root\n   causes. MPI has been evaluated in both a simulation environment and a\n   real network system for its accuracy and efficiency.

Datacenter\n   architects are responding with various strategies, including capping the\n   power available to computing systems. Throttling bandwidth has been\n   proposed to cap the power usage of the disk drive. This work revisits\n   throttling and addresses its shortcomings. We show that, contrary to the\n   common belief, the disk's power usage does not always increase as the\n   disk's throughput increases. Furthermore, throttling unnecessarily\n   sacrifices I/O response times by idling the disk. We propose a technique\n   that resizes the queues of the disk to cap its power. Resizing queues\n   not only imposes no delays on servicing requests, but also enables\n   performance differentiation. We present the design and implementation of\n   PCAP, an agile performance-aware power capping system for the disk\n   drive. PCAP dynamically resizes the disk's queues to cap power. It\n   operates in two performance-aware modes, throughput and tail-latency,\n   making it viable for cloud systems with service-level differentiation.\n   We evaluate PCAP for different workloads and disk drives. Our\n   experiments show that PCAP reduces power by up to 22\\%. Further, under\n   PCAP, 60\\% of the requests observe service times below 100 ms compared\n   to just 10\\% under throttling.

However, for certain defense\n   applications, the total angle x diameter product, or the mirror's\n   effective achievable resolution (theta{*}D product), has not been large\n   enough to address requirements for agile steering in large fields of\n   regard and with a low diffraction-limited beam divergence.

The rotating\n   electrostatic combdrive has its torque multiplied by liquid's relative\n   permittivity of similar to 2.5. Furthermore, by selecting the\n   appropriate fluid viscosity, quality factor of the device is reduced and\n   structural damping is tuned to near critical damping. Finally, the\n   increased scan angle due to the similar to 1.5-1.7 index of refraction\n   of the fluid is an additional benefit. These numerous benefits of the\n   fluidic packaging enabled us to double and in some cases triple the\n   previously achieved theta{*}D product of two-axis quasistatic MEMS\n   mirrors while still maintaining speeds applicable for above mentioned\n   applications.

It is\n   hard to make developers work faster but it is possible to make them work\n   more efficient. One way to achieve that is to introduce agile\n   development methods. Agile methods are gaining increasing popularity in\n   safety critical areas such as the petrochemical industry. Agile methods\n   promise reduced costs and shorter time to market through incremental\n   development, less production of unnecessary documents and more\n   maintainable code. The IEC 61511: 2003 standard is normally used by the\n   petrochemical industry. The second edition of this standard will be\n   issued in 2015.\n   Both the current and the new draft edition IEC 61511: 2014 of the IEC\n   61511 standard are evaluated against agile development approach in this\n   paper. Both editions of the IEC 61511 standard have a strong link to IEC\n   61508. Manufacturers and suppliers of devices shall use IEC 61508, while\n   system designers, integrators and users shall use IEC 61511. The IEC\n   61508 standard's relationship to agile development has been evaluated\n   with success in a previous paper (Stalhane 2012).\n   While the architectural design also in agile development is done up\n   front, detailed design is done incrementally. Based on reported\n   experiences in other domains, we expect the following benefits:\n   Easier to discover and correct faulty or incomplete system requirements\n   Simpler software, thus reducing the development and maintenance costs\n   Only documents that are needed, either for certification or development,\n   are developed The ones that are developed are used and kept up-to-date\n   Improved opportunities for reuse and site development.\n   The challenge is to introduce agile development without compromising\n   safety. Development of safety systems needs to be compliant with IEC\n   61511. This standard impose rigor and additional costs, but proper\n   adaptation of agile methods can add flexibility and efficiency. In order\n   to evaluate this proposition we use a three step process:\n   Go through all relevant requirements in the standard and mark all\n   requirements as (1) fully met using agile development, (2) possible to\n   meet using agile development and (3) cannot be fulfilled ``as is{''}\n   using agile development.\n   All requirements in category (2) are studied further in order to assign\n   them to category (1) - OK, category (2) adaptations to the agile method\n   by including add-on's or category (3) - changes to the development\n   process.\n   Suggest appropriate modifications to the agile development.\n   This is the same process that we have used with success for IEC 61508\n   (Stalhane 2012) and IEC 60880 (Stalhane 2013). The work on IEC 61508\n   resulted in a method called SafeScrum. The SafeScrum model are reused\n   and improved to fit the current and new edition of IEC 61511. There are\n   no requirements in the current standards that prevents for an adjusted\n   agile development process as SafeScrum.\n   When the issues identified as category 2 in section 2 are settled, it\n   should be straight forward to use SafeScrum and still be IEC 61511\n   conformant. It is now important to get one or more companies to try it\n   out in cooperation with the certification bodies and / or authorities to\n   get a reality check of the concepts discussed. This will allow us to\n   identify possible problems and to make the adjustments necessary for\n   industrial application. The main challenges are the IEC 61511\n   requirements on configuration management, traceability, detailed\n   planning and documentation.\n   However, in order to reap the full benefits of agile development, it is\n   not enough to show conformance to IEC 61511. Suggested improvements of\n   IEC 61511 are more requirements and information regarding modern\n   software development methods. This is also in accordance with\n   preliminary work performed by the current IEC 61508-3 maintenance\n   committee.}","ISSN":"{0149-144X}","ISBN":"{978-1-5090-0249-8}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000383954600115}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000383845100036","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Valter, Narcisa and Androniceanu, Armenia and Dragulanescu,\n   Irina-Virginia and Duca, Mioara","Editor":"{Pamfilie, R and Dinu, V and Tachiciu, L and Plesea, D and Vasiliu, C}","Title":"{AGILE MANAGEMENT BASED ON MODULARIZATION OF PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES}","Booktitle":"{BASIQ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE: NEW TRENDS IN SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS AND\n   CONSUMPTION 2016}","Series":"{Proceedings of BASIQ}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{310-318}","Note":"{Basiq International Conference - New Trends in Sustainable Business and\n   Consumption, Konstanz, GERMANY, JUN 02-03, 2016}","Organization":"{Allensbach Univ; AE}","Abstract":"{Currently, to withstand on the market and especially to make profits,\n   companies must be able to modify their production strategies in order to\n   respond quickly, with quality products at minimal costs.

Recent widespread adoption of Electronic\n   Health Records (EHRs) in the U.S. now makes possible construction of\n   EHR-based specialty registry data collection tools and reports,\n   previously unfeasible using manual chart abstraction. But the\n   complexities of specialty registry EHR tools and measures, along with\n   the variety of stakeholders involved, can result in misunderstood\n   requirements and frequent product change requests, as users first\n   experience the tools in their actual clinical workflows. Such\n   requirements churn could easily stall progress in specialty registry\n   rollout.

They are becoming more and more\n   ``software-based.{''} The use of Network Function Virtualization (NFV)\n   to run network services in software enables Software Defined Networks\n   (SDN) to create a largely software-based network. To truly achieve the\n   vision of a high-performance software-based network that is flexible,\n   lower-cost, and agile, a fast and carefully designed network function\n   virtualization platform along with a comprehensive SDN control plane is\n   needed.\n   Our high-performance NFV platform, OpenNetVM, enables high bandwidth\n   network functions to operate at near line speed, while taking advantage\n   of the flexibility and customization of low cost commodity servers.\n   OpenNetVM exploits Intel's DPDK libraries to minimize the overhead of\n   packet processing, and to provide high throughput, low latency\n   networking in virtualized environments. OpenNetVM allows true zero-copy\n   delivery of data to VMs, both for packet processing and highspeed\n   inter-VM communication through shared huge pages within a trust\n   boundary. We envision a dynamic and flexible network that can support a\n   smarter data plane than just simple switches that forward packets. We\n   build on our OpenNetVM NFV platform by developing our SDNFV network\n   architecture that supports complex stateful routing of flows where\n   processing by network functions (NFs) can dynamically modify the path\n   taken by flows, without unduly burdening the centralized SDN controller.\n   The tutorial will also briefly touch upon the problem of dynamic\n   placement of network functions and routing of flows through a software\n   based network, exploiting a mixture of centralized SDN control and NFV\n   capabilities in the network. The problem can be formulated as a mixed\n   integer linear programming problem, and heuristics can be used to solve\n   the problem incrementally.\n   As a case study, we examine the growing communication needs of\n   `Internet-of-Things' (IoT). With `smart' sensing devices becoming\n   ubiquitous, there is a need to support IoT communication at large scale,\n   especially over cellular networks. The use of NFV platforms for the\n   Evolved Packet Core, we see opportunities for supporting IoT\n   communications at large scale in 5G cellular networks. We will describe\n   potential solutions in this direction.}","DOI":"{10.1109/ICDCS.2016.112}","ISSN":"{1063-6927}","ISBN":"{978-1-5090-1482-8}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000383224500004}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000383741200016","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Ghobadi, Monia and Mahajan, Ratul and Phanishayee, Amar and Devanur,\n   Nikhil and Kulkarni, Janardhan and Ranade, Gireeja and Blanche,\n   Pierre-Alexandre and Rastegarfar, Houman and Glick, Madeleine and\n   Kilper, Daniel","Book-Group-Author":"{ACM}","Title":"{ProjecToR: Agile Reconfigurable Data Center Interconnect}","Booktitle":"{PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 ACM CONFERENCE ON SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP ON DATA\n   COMMUNICATION (SIGCOMM `16)}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{216-229}","Note":"{ACM Conference on Special Interest Group on Data Communication\n   (SIGCOMM), Florianopolis, BRAZIL, AUG 22-26, 2016}","Organization":"{Assoc Comp Machinery; ACM SIGCOMM}","Abstract":"{We explore a novel, free-space optics based approach for building data\n   center interconnects.

Increasing\n   development of Engineering Method and public welcome for constructing\n   coincident methods and special for a private project, or an organization\n   or a general method that fits the characteristics and needs of the\n   software team, existence of right and systematic frameworks, codified\n   rules and proper guidelines in process of method production are of the\n   challenges that nowadays specialist of method engineering face with.\n   This paper presents a framework for generalization of agile methods\n   based on requirements for e-commerce applications which include three\n   phases of starting, construction of methodology and ending and each\n   phase includes a number of stages. The purpose of the proposed framework\n   is to categorize and assess the needs of e-commerce and examination of\n   present techniques and patterns in agile methods and selection of\n   appropriate patterns to improve base agile method for e-commerce\n   applications.}","ISBN":"{978-1-5090-2166-6}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000382852800020}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382829700024","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Furdek, Marija and Muhammad, Ajmal and Zervas, Georgios and Alloune,\n   Nabih and Tremblay, Christine and Wosinska, Lena","Book-Group-Author":"{IEEE}","Title":"{Programmable Filterless Network Architecture Based on Optical White\n   Boxes}","Booktitle":"{20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OPTICAL NETWORK DESIGN AND MODELING\n   (ONDM 2016)}","Year":"{2016}","Note":"{International Conference on Optical Network Design and Modeling (ONDM),\n   Tech Univ Cartagena, Murcia, SPAIN, MAY 09-12, 2016}","Organization":"{IEEE}","Abstract":"{We propose and evaluate a novel architecture enabling high-capacity,\n   resource efficient and agile elastic optical networks.

An ASC is a dynamic alliance of member\n   enterprises, the adaptation of which is likely to introduce velocity,\n   responsiveness and flexibility into the manufacturing system. In ASC\n   management, supplier/partner selection is a key strategic concern;\n   influenced by various agility-related criteria/attributes. Therefore,\n   evaluation and selection of potential supplier in an ASC has become an\n   important multi-criteria decision-making problem. The purpose of this\n   paper is to report, a supplier selection procedure (module) in the\n   context of ASC.\n   Design/methodology/approach - During supplier selection, subjectivity of\n   evaluation information (human judgment) often creates conflict and bears\n   some kind of uncertainty. To overcome this, the present work attempts to\n   explore vague set theory to deal with uncertainties in the supplier\n   selection decision-making process. Since, vague sets can provide more\n   accurate information as compared to fuzzy sets. It considers true\n   membership function as well as false membership function which give more\n   superior results for uncertain information. In this procedure, first,\n   linguistic variables have been used to assess appropriateness rating\n   (performance extent) as well as priority weights for individual\n   quantitative or qualitative criterions. Second, the concept of degree of\n   similarity and probability of vague sets has been used to determine\n   appropriate ranking order of the potential supplier alternatives.\n   Findings - A case empirical example has been provided. It has been\n   proved that the methodology would be fruitful in considering different\n   evaluation criterion (indices); may be contradicting in nature like\n   beneficial and cost criterions. The application of vague set theory has\n   also been proved as a better option to work under uncertain (fuzzy)\n   decision-making environment in comparison to fuzzy set theory.\n   Originality/value - The application of vague set theory in\n   multi-criteria group decision making has been reported in literature to\n   a limited extent. Application of vague set as a decision-making tool in\n   agile supplier selection appears relative new and unexplored work area.\n   The work has got remarkable managerial implications.}","DOI":"{10.1108/BIJ-03-2014-0020}","ISSN":"{1463-5771}","EISSN":"{1758-4094}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000382537300006}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382670000006","entryType":"incollection","entryTags":{"Author":"Christopher, Martin and Harrison, Alan and van Hoek, Remko","Editor":"{Pawar, KS and Rogers, H and Potter, A and Naim, M}","Title":"{Creating the Agile Supply Chain: Issues and Challenges}","Booktitle":"{DEVELOPMENTS IN LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT: PAST, PRESENT AND\n   FUTURE}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{61-68}","ISBN":"{978-1-137-54125-3; 978-1-137-54123-9}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000382670000006}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382670000007","entryType":"incollection","entryTags":{"Author":"Pearson, Michael and Masson, Ron and Swain, Anthony","Editor":"{Pawar, KS and Rogers, H and Potter, A and Naim, M}","Title":"{Process Control in Agile Supply Chain Networks}","Booktitle":"{DEVELOPMENTS IN LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT: PAST, PRESENT AND\n   FUTURE}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{69-79}","ISBN":"{978-1-137-54125-3; 978-1-137-54123-9}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000382670000007}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000382224200002","entryType":"inproceedings","entryTags":{"Author":"Wang, Yang and Wagner, Stefan","Book-Group-Author":"{ACM}","Title":"{Towards Applying a Safety Analysis and Verification Method based on STPA\n   to Agile Software Development}","Booktitle":"{INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CONTINUOUS SOFTWARE EVOLUTION AND DELIVERY,\n   CSED 2016}","Year":"{2016}","Pages":"{5-11}","Note":"{1st International Workshop on Continuous Software Evolution and Delivery\n   (CSED), Austin, TX, MAY 14-15, 2016}","Organization":"{Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Tech Council Software Engn;\n   ACM Special Interest Grp Software Engn}","Abstract":"{Agile methodologies are becoming widespread in modern software\n   development. However, due to a lack of safety assurance activities,\n   agile methods are criticized for being inadequate for the development of\n   safe software.

It has become so important that organizations have begun to\n   directly manage the supply chain, appointing specific managers to\n   perform this function. New challenges now include a focus on supply to\n   determine the right time and place for product delivery. Some authors\n   indicate a close relationship between Total Quality Management and the\n   supply chain regarding its philosophical and operational goals and\n   perspectives. Lee (2004) goes even further by indicating that only\n   organizations that devise agile, adaptable and aligned supply chains\n   will be able to continue competing in today's environment. Therefore,\n   observing and measuring the supply chain at all times is critical for\n   today's organizations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the\n   implementation of a tool called Supply Chain Value Stream Mapping\n   (SCVSM) in order to thoroughly understand competitive priorities of\n   volume and delivery (On-time Delivery (OTD)) for any supply chain in\n   organizations.\n   Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory case study was conducted.\n   Two manufacturing company which have been established in Mexico with a\n   robust supply chain for at least 20 years, were selected. The paper\n   chronicles the implementation of SCVSM in both case studies. Three\n   methods were used to gather data: direct observation; documentary\n   analysis and semi-structured interviews.\n   Findings - This paper proposes a new tool for operation management\n   called SCVSM. Its development, refinement and applied in both case\n   studies. The evidence shows that it is possible to apply the tool\n   (SCVSM) to visualize the variables volume and OTD in supply chains. In\n   consequence, this research has made a small empirical contribution to\n   the theoretical field of supply chain quality management.\n   Research limitations/implications - This paper has the same limitations\n   as all other case-study-based research, including analysis subjectivity\n   and questionable generalization of findings. There may well also be a\n   theoretical gap in the geographic region because the paper only analyzes\n   two companies established in Mexico.\n   Practical implications - Derived to describe both case studies on how to\n   apply the SCVSM tool it may prove to be of value to practitioners and\n   managers involved in the field.

An international MBDA team has been\n   set up to identify commonalities in any command and control application\n   within the air defence scope. This work led to an open architecture that\n   encapsulates elements that depend on weapon system specificities by the\n   ones that are common. The common elements, covering surveillance, threat\n   evaluation, weapon assignment and engagement control functions within\n   the wide MBDA's set of effectors, have been developed using MBDA\n   Internal Research Funding and now are used to build up next-generation\n   C2 solutions. The extendible concept behind the framework architecture\n   allows the use of the `MBDA Extendible C2' during the initial phases of\n   the contract (assessment phase, derisking, demonstrator, research) and\n   for the deployment phase by providing the possibility for closed-loop\n   feedback within the customer. The need to work collaboratively across\n   nations leads to the design and delivery of the MBDA Collaborative\n   Environment (or CEM) solution that is a collaborative engineering\n   virtual laboratory for members who are located in separate sites. This\n   environment is protected, which therefore enables the efficient sharing\n   of data between Italy and other entities. This environment is a\n   desktop-virtualization-based technology that creates a cohesive and\n   scalable solution and centralizes the Italian infrastructure. This\n   reduces development time as it allows real-time development and review\n   of design artefacts, reducing the risk of duplication of effort.

Traditional architecture development is based on three\n   architectural phases: architectural analysis, architectural synthesis\n   and architectural evaluation. The highly ceremonial character of the\n   traditional process is also reflected in the role of the software\n   architect, who is responsible for generating numerous architectural\n   artefacts.\n   The proponents of agile development start from the position that an\n   architecture emerges gradually, after every iteration, as a result of\n   continuous code refactoring, rather than from a previously built\n   structure.

Using a\n   single case study of a global telecommunications company as an example,\n   the authors demonstrate how supply chain complexity can effectively be\n   mastered by adopting a project management orientation and in the process\n   enabling outcomes that are `leagile', that is, both lean and agile.}","DOI":"{10.1080/13675567.2015.1073234}","ISSN":"{1367-5567}","EISSN":"{1469-848X}","ResearcherID-Numbers":"{GAUDENZI, Barbara/M-6928-2015}","ORCID-Numbers":"{GAUDENZI, Barbara/0000-0003-1577-8256}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000374849200002}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000374235400002","entryType":"article","entryTags":{"Author":"Bouslama, Moufida and Traii, Moubarek and Denidni, Tayeb A. and\n   Gharsallah, Ali","Title":"{Beam-Switching Antenna With a New Reconfigurable Frequency Selective\n   Surface}","Journal":"{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}","Year":"{2016}","Volume":"{15}","Pages":"{1159-1162}","Abstract":"{In this letter, a design of a beam-sweeping antenna using a new active\n   frequency selective surface (FSS) is presented.

The purpose of this paper is to apply two main theoretical frames\n   from the strategy literature, dynamic capabilities, and organizational\n   ambidexterity, to supply chain management (SCM) to examine mitigation\n   strategies for supply chain (SC) disruptions. The authors empirically\n   investigated how the firm's SC ambidexterity is developed through a\n   dynamic capability-building process and how this, in turn, can mitigate\n   the negative impact of SC disruptions and improve business performance.\n   Design/methodology/approach - This study conducted a field survey to\n   answer the research questions as there exists no archival database with\n   detailed information on ambidextrous SC strategies and dynamic\n   capability.

It is for the first time that the\n   half-wavelength resonant mode of CPS-fed strip loop antenna is exploited\n   for frequency-agile operation. First, the matching method for a CPS-fed\n   strip loop antenna to operate at its fundamental mode, i.e.,\n   half-wavelength resonance, is discussed. Second, for reducing the\n   antenna size, an inductor L-ter is used to change the boundary condition\n   at the virtual-short point along the strip loop. For a given perimeter\n   of the loop, increasing L-ter lowers its resonant frequency. The design\n   concept is verified through a series of prototype antennas loaded with\n   chip inductors of different values. Third, frequency agility is achieved\n   by replacing the chip inductor by a tunable inductor, which, in this\n   study, is realized by connecting an inductor of larger inductance in\n   series with a varactor diode. A prototype antenna is also designed,\n   fabricated, and tested.

There is a wide spectrum\n   in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices\n   conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is\n   important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software\n   engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their\n   companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners\n   developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software\n   size measurement approaches more, or use different software development\n   methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other\n   sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in\n   small versus large companies?\n   Objective: Our objective is to get an understanding into the\n   cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices\n   versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects\n   (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding\n   will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which\n   should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific\n   demographic (e.g., small versus large companies). Thus, we decided to\n   conduct an exploratory study in this area and collected real industrial\n   data in the context of Turkey which has a vibrant software industry.\n   Method: To achieve the above objective, we use the data from a recent\n   Turkish-wide survey of software engineering practices which was\n   systematically designed with 46 questions based on our past experience\n   in the Canadian context and using the Software Engineering Body of\n   Knowledge (SWEBOK). 202 practicing software engineers participated in\n   the survey. We raise a set of 12 research questions about the\n   cross-factor correlation of software engineering practices and\n   practitioner demographics, and address them using statistical analysis.\n   Results: The exploratory study results reveal important and interesting\n   findings about cross-factor relationship of software engineering\n   practices and practitioner demographics. Among some of the most\n   interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we\n   were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of\n   work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more\n   challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and SE\n   tasks; (2) Almost 55\\% of participants measure software size; (3)\n   Agile/lean development is used the least (16\\%) by the participants\n   working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4)\n   Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small sized\n   companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among\n   this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of\n   spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme\n   programming practices decreases.\n   Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study will be useful to\n   software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and\n   world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software\n   engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises\n   several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many\n   practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how\n   these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more\n   frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and\n   challenging experiences in using SE tools?, and (3) Why is Agile lean\n   development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how\n   these approaches could be utilized more frequently.

Although intra-team interaction is well supported by\n   established agile practices, the critical interaction between the agile\n   team and other parts of the organization is still unexplored in\n   literature. Such interactions slow down the development, hindering the\n   achievement of business goals based on speed: short time to market,\n   quick replication of products of a product-line, and reaction time for\n   product evolution. We have employed a two-year long multiple-case\n   case-study, collecting data through interviews and a survey in three\n   large companies developing embedded software. Through a combination of\n   qualitative and quantitative analysis, we have found strong evidence\n   that interaction challenges between the development team and other\n   groups in the organization hinder speed and are widespread in the\n   organizations. This paper also identifies current practices in use at\n   the studied companies and provides detailed guidelines for novel\n   solutions in the investigated domain. Such practices are called\n   boundary-spanning activities in information system research and\n   coordination theory. We present a comparison between large embedded\n   software companies employing agile and developing a line of products\n   based on reused assets and agile companies developing pure software. We\n   highlight specific contextual factors and areas where novel spanning\n   activities are needed for mitigating the interaction challenges\n   hindering speed.

Moreover, we\n   conceptualize that the degree of fit (or match) between a project's\n   software process diversity and the level of process compliance enforced\n   on the project impacts overall project performance.

A specific domain where FBMC offers\n   a clear advantage over other multicarrier solutions is the efficient\n   occupancy of underutilized and fragmented spectrum. This is due to the\n   rich spectral containment of the FBMC technology, which guarantees\n   superior interference protection to the primary coexisting\n   transmissions. These features of FBMC could play an important role in\n   the economic delivery of 5G services in licensed and unlicensed bands.\n   This article focuses on the public safety domain where existing\n   professional mobile radio (PMR) users plan to add broadband services at\n   the 400 MHz band, aiming to occupy the spectral holes left by current\n   narrowband transmissions. In this respect an agile SDR broadband\n   downlink FBMC system, aimed at exploiting unused licensed PMR spectrum,\n   was developed and experimentally validated. The FBMC frame structure\n   shared key similarities with the LTE specification. Two different SDR\n   design methodologies were used to build the real-time baseband\n   prototype. The level of interference protection offered by a broadband\n   FBMC system to a coexisting primary narrowband PMR transmission was\n   practically demonstrated and compared to that of an equivalent LTE\n   system.

Objective: This\n   study seeks to evaluate, synthesize, and present aspects of research on\n   agile methods tailoring including the method tailoring approaches\n   adopted and the criteria used for agile practice selection. Method: The\n   method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies\n   published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been\n   identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches. These\n   studies have been identified as case studies regarding the empirical\n   research, as solution proposals regarding the research type, and as\n   evaluation studies regarding the research validation type. Most of the\n   papers used method engineering to implement tailoring and were not\n   specific to any agile method on their scope. Conclusion: Most of agile\n   methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were\n   implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated\n   their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for\n   tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main\n   criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables.

The evaluation indicates\n   challenges and limitations of relying on existing labeling practices and\n   shows a clear advantage of using the proposed approach in discovering a\n   more complete set of potentially malicious domains and IF addresses.\n   Furthermore, the novel approach attains time-efficient labeling with\n   limited operator's involvement, thus is promising in view of the\n   adoption in operational ISP networks.

To enable efficient CR communications, a reliable\n   control channel (CC) for exchanging control information is needed. In\n   this paper, a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)-based underlay CC\n   design for distributed coordination in CR networks (CRNs) is proposed.\n   The proposed design provides immunity to licensed primary radio (PR)\n   interference (reliable communication), low transmission power (PR users'\n   protection) and predefined-required transmission rate and range (network\n   connectivity). The Proposed design ensures that both narrow-band data\n   and wide-band control transmissions can be simultaneously proceeded\n   while protecting the performance of PR users. To ensure reliable CR\n   control communications, a closed-form expression is derived for the\n   minimum required transmission power for control packet transmissions\n   such that required transmission range and rate are achieved. Based on\n   the derived expression, the maximum allowable transmission power for CR\n   data transmissions is computed such that an enforced power mask\n   constrain over the PR channels is not violated.

Whereas software was once considered a detail to be\n   bundled, it has since become an intricate and interdependent part of\n   most products. The advancement of software increases the uncertainty and\n   the interdependencies between development tasks and artifacts. A key\n   success factor is good requirements engineering (RE), and in particular,\n   the challenges of effectively and efficiently coordinating and\n   communicating requirements.\n   Objective: In this work we present a lightweight RE framework and\n   demonstrate and evaluate its industrial applicability in response to the\n   needs of a Swedish automotive company for improving specific problems in\n   inter-departmental requirements coordination and communication in\n   large-scale development of software-intensive systems.\n   Method: A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to\n   develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our\n   industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car\n   project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations\n   when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in\n   a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews.\n   Results: The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed\n   that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful\n   and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and\n   communicating requirements identified at the case company. However,\n   other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and\n   competences in the early development phases, were identified when using\n   the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken.\n   Conclusion: Overall, the experience from using the framework and the\n   positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible\n   framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems\n   related to coordination and communication of requirements.

There is a need to model\n   agile enterprise architecture artefacts both at the high and low\n   detailed level for a particular context. ArchiMate is relatively a new\n   high-level architecture modelling standard. There is a growing interest\n   amongst organisations in applying ArchiMate for high-level agile\n   enterprise architecture modelling. However, organisations are unsure how\n   to effectively apply ArchiMate at high-level and integrate it with their\n   existing low detailed level modelling standards in practice for\n   supporting end-to-end agile enterprise architecture modelling.\n   Objective: This paper evaluates the applicability and integration of\n   high-level ArchiMate modelling standard with the existing low-level\n   modelling standards such as BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation),\n   UML (Unified Modelling Language), FAML (FAME {[}Framework for\n   Agent-Oriented Method Engineering] Language), SoaML (Service Oriented\n   Architecture Modelling Language), and BMM (Business Motivation Model).\n   Method: A qualitative questionnaire-based evaluation criteria has been\n   developed based on the well-known and comprehensive The Open Group\n   Architecture Framework (TOGAF). The evaluation criteria has been applied\n   to evaluate the applicability and integration of the selected six\n   modelling standards from the business, application, infrastructure and\n   extension perspectives.\n   Results: Each modelling standard is different in scope. A single\n   modelling standard usually does not provide the kind of support required\n   by the agile enterprise architecture modelling.

Because the results produced by the\n   software drive important decisions, the software must be correct and\n   developed efficiently. Various software engineering practices have been\n   shown to increase correctness and efficiency in the development of\n   traditional software. It is unclear whether these observations will hold\n   in a scientific context.\n   Objective: This paper evaluates claims from software engineers and\n   scientific software developers about 12 different software engineering\n   practices and their use in developing scientific software.\n   Method: We performed a systematic literature review examining claims\n   about how scientists develop software. Of the 189 papers originally\n   identified, 43 are included in the literature review. These 43 papers\n   contain 33 different claims about 12 software engineering practices.\n   Results: The majority of the claims indicated that software engineering\n   practices are useful for scientific software development. Every claim\n   was supported by evidence (i.e. personal experience, interview/survey,\n   or case study) with slightly over half supported by multiple forms of\n   evidence. For those claims supported by only one type of evidence,\n   interviews/surveys were the most common. The claims that received the\n   most support were: ``The effectiveness of the testing practices\n   currently used by scientific software developers is limited{''} and\n   ``Version control software is necessary for research groups with more\n   than one developer.{''} Additionally, many scientific software\n   developers have unconsciously adopted an agile-like development\n   methodology.\n   Conclusion: Use of software engineering practices could increase the\n   correctness of scientific software and the efficiency of its\n   development.

However, crowdsourcing applications in the\n   fields of design research and creative innovation have been much slower\n   to emerge. So, although there have been reports of systems and\n   researchers using Internet crowdsourcing to carry out generative design,\n   there are still many gaps in knowledge about the capability and\n   limitations of the technology.

As a contribution to the development of such a general model\n   this paper proposes a cDesign framework to support the creation of\n   crowdsourced design activities. Within the cDesign framework the\n   effective evaluation of design quality is identified as a key component\n   that not only enables the leveraging of a large, virtual workforce's\n   creative activities but is also fundamental to almost all iterative\n   optimisation processes.

The platform is mostly constructed of low-cost\n   commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The only non-COTS components\n   are the airdata probes, which are manufactured and calibrated in-house.\n   The airframe used is the commercially available radio-controlled (R/C)\n   6-foot Telemaster airplane from Hobby Express, chosen mainly for its\n   adequately spacious fuselage and for being reasonably stable and\n   sufficiently agile. One noteworthy feature of this platform is the use\n   of two separate low-cost onboard computers for handling the data\n   management/hardware interfacing and control computation. Specifically,\n   the single board computer, Gumstix Overo Fire, is used to execute the\n   control algorithms, whereas the open source autopilot, Ardupilot Mega,\n   is mostly used to interface the Overo computer with the sensors and\n   actuators. The platform supports multi-vehicle operations through the\n   use of a radio modem that enables multi-point communications. As the\n   goal of this platform is to implement rigorous control algorithms for\n   real-time trajectory tracking and distributed control, it is important\n   to derive an appropriate flight dynamic model of the platform, based on\n   which the controllers will be synthesized. For that matter, the paper\n   provides reasonably accurate models of the vehicle, servomotors, and\n   propulsion system.

There is a wide spectrum in\n   terms of the types and maturity of SE practices conducted in industry.\n   Turkey has a vibrant software industry and it is important to\n   characterize and understand the state of its SE practices. Our objective\n   is to characterize and grasp a high-level view on type of SE practices\n   in the Turkish software industry. To achieve this objective, we\n   systematically designed an online survey with 46 questions based on our\n   past experience in the Canadian and Turkish contexts and using the\n   Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Two hundred and two\n   practicing software engineers from the Turkish software industry\n   participated in the survey. The survey results reveal important and\n   interesting findings about SE practices in Turkey and beyond. They also\n   help track the profession of SE, and suggest areas for improved\n   training, education and research. Among the findings are the followings:\n   (1) The military and defense software sectors are quite prominent in\n   Turkey, especially in the capital Ankara region, and many SE\n   practitioners work for those companies. (2) 54\\% of the participants\n   reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33\\%\n   mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of\n   effort, after the development phase (on average, 31\\% of overall project\n   effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases\n   come next and have similar average values (14\\%, 12\\%, 12\\% and 11\\%\n   respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the\n   requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used\n   lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents\n   (53\\%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and\n   Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38\\% and 34\\%,\n   respectively. (6) The Waterfall and Agile methodologies have slight\n   negative correlations, denoting that if one is used in a company, the\n   other will less likely to be used. The results of our survey will be of\n   interest to SE professionals both in Turkey and world-wide. It will also\n   benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in SE industry\n   identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then\n   hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in those\n   areas.

The study of this flow amounts to a\n   specific instance of the hydrodynamics problem for rough tapered\n   cylinder geometries. The outstanding manipulative and locomotor skills\n   of octopuses could inspire the development of advanced robotic arms,\n   able to operate in fluid environments. Our primary aim was to study the\n   hydrodynamic characteristics of such bio-inspired robotic models and to\n   derive the hydrodynamic force coefficients as a concise description of\n   the vortical flow effects. Utilizing computational fluid dynamic\n   methods, the coefficients were computed on realistic morphologies of\n   octopus-like arm models undergoing prescribed solid-body movements; such\n   motions occur in nature for short durations in time, e.g. during\n   reaching movements and exploratory behaviors. Numerical simulations were\n   performed on translating, impulsively rotating, and maneuvering arms,\n   around which the flow field structures were investigated. The results\n   reveal in detail the generation of complex vortical flow structures\n   around the moving arms. Hydrodynamic forces acting on a translating arm\n   depend on the angle of incidence; forces generated during impulsive\n   rotations of the arms are independent of their exact morphology and the\n   angle of rotation; periodic motions based on a slow recovery and a fast\n   power stroke are able to produce considerable propulsive thrust while\n   harmonic motions are not. Parts of these results have been employed in\n   bio-inspired models of underwater robotic mechanisms.

In the model, consumers decide the purchase timing and the\n   firm chooses the inventory level. We find that the loss-averse\n   consumers' strategic purchasing behavior is determined by their\n   perceived gain and loss from strategic purchase delay, and the given\n   rationing risk. Thus, the firm that is cognizant of this property\n   tailors its inventory stocking policy based on the consumers'\n   loss-averse behavior such as their perceived values of gain and loss,\n   and their sensitivity to them. We also demonstrate that the firm's\n   equilibrium inventory stocking policy reflects both the economic logic\n   of the traditional newsvendor inventory model, and the loss-averse\n   behavior of consumers. The equilibrium order quantity is significantly\n   different from those derived from models that assume that the consumers\n   are risk neutral and homogeneous in their valuations. We show that the\n   firm that ignores strategic consumer's loss-aversion behavior tends to\n   keep an unnecessarily high inventory level that leads to excessive\n   leftovers. Our numerical experiments further reveal that in some extreme\n   cases the firm that ignores strategic consumer's loss-aversion behavior\n   generates almost 92\\% more leftovers than the firm that possesses\n   consumers' loss-aversion information and takes it into account when\n   making managerial decisions. To mitigate the consumer's forward-looking\n   behavior, we propose the adoption of the practice of agile supply chain\n   management, which possesses the following attributes: (i) procuring\n   inventory after observing real-time demand information, (ii) enhanced\n   design (which maintains the current production mix but improves the\n   product performance to a higher level), and (iii) customized design\n   (which maintains the current performance level but increases the variety\n   of the current production line to meet consumers' specific demands). We\n   show that such a practice can induce the consumer to make early\n   purchases by increasing their rationing risk, increasing the product\n   value, or diversifying the product line.

This type of networks is\n   used in several network applications; such as Local Area Networks (LAN)\n   and Data Center Networks (DCN). In LANs and DCNs, high-speed and\n   short-distance networks are commonly deployed to connect between\n   computing and storage elements in order to provide rapid services.\n   Indeed, the overall performance of such networks is significantly\n   influenced by the Congestion Control Algorithm (CCA) which suffers from\n   the problem of bandwidth under-utilization, especially if the applied\n   buffer regime is very small. In this paper, a novel loss-based CCA\n   tailored for high-speed and Short-Distance (SD) networks, namely\n   Agile-SD, has been proposed. The main contribution of the proposed CCA\n   is to implement the mechanism of agility factor. Further, intensive\n   simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance\n   of Agile-SD compared to Compound and Cubic Which are the default CCAs of\n   the most commonly used operating systems. The results of the simulation\n   experiments show that the proposed CCA outperforms the compared CCAs in\n   terms of average throughput, loss ratio and fairness, especially when a\n   small buffer is applied. Moreover, Agile-SD shows lower sensitivity to\n   the buffer size change and packet error rate variation which increases\n   its efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A critical challenge in\n   deploying PMU-based RTSE applications at large scale is the lack of a\n   scalable and flexible communication infrastructure for the timely (i.e.,\n   sub-second) delivery of the high volume of synchronized and continuous\n   synchrophasor measurements. We address this challenge by introducing a\n   communication platform called C-DAX based on the information-centric\n   networking (ICN) concept. With a topic-based publish-subscribe engine\n   that decouples data producers and consumers in time and space, C-DAX\n   enables efficient synchrophasor measurement delivery, as well as\n   flexible and scalable (re) configuration of PMU data communication for\n   seamless full observability of power conditions in complex and dynamic\n   scenarios.

This leap, however, adds complexity to optimizing\n   transmission. Not only does the appropriate data rate need to be\n   selected, but also the MIMO transmission technique (e.g., Spatial\n   Diversity or Spatial Multiplexing), the number of streams, and the\n   channel width. Incorporating these features into a rate adaptation (RA)\n   solution requires a new set of rules to accurately evaluate channel\n   conditions and select the appropriate transmission setting with minimal\n   overhead. To address these challenges, our contributions in this work\n   are two-fold. First, we propose a practical link metric that accurately\n   captures channel conditions in MIMO 802.11n environments, and we call\n   this metric diffSNR. Using diffSNR captured from real testbed\n   environments, we build performance models that accuractely predict link\n   quality in 95.5\\% of test cases. Practicality and deployability are\n   guaranteed with diffSNR as it can be measured on all off-the-shelf MIMO\n   WiFi chipsets. Second, we propose ARAMIS (Agile Rate Adaptation for MIMO\n   Systems), a standard-compliant, closed-loop RA solution that jointly\n   adapts rate and bandwidth, and we utilize the diffSNR-based 802.11n\n   performance models within ARAMIS's framework. ARAMIS adapts transmission\n   rates on a per-packet basis; we believe it is the first closed-loop,\n   802.11 RA algorithm that simultaneously adapts rate and channel width.\n   We have implemented ARAMIS with diffSNR on Atheros-based devices and\n   deployed it on our 15-node testbed. Our experiments show that ARAMIS\n   accurately adapts to a wide variety of channel conditions with\n   negligible overhead. Furthermore, ARAMIS outperforms existing RA\n   algorithms in 802.11n environments with up to a 10-fold increase in\n   throughput. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

That\n   is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in\n   which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing\n   constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders.\n   Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more\n   complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant\n   publics implicates.

Today,\n   unfortunately, this capability does not exist. Why? Because most\n   suppliers use proprietary information models to represent and share\n   their MSC information! This limits both the semantic precision in the\n   models, which is needed for interoperability, and the level of agility\n   in the supply chains. The availability of a semantically precise and\n   rich reference MSC ontology could address both of these limitations.\n   Based on our prior research, the development of such an ontology will\n   require a semantic mediation process between the proprietary MSC models\n   and the reference MSC ontology.

The\n   research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software\n   development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team\n   members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to\n   navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions.\n   Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was\n   evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a\n   large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the\n   feasibility of composing processes for three software development\n   projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing\n   (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search\n   (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing\n   the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to\n   verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her\n   expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable\n   sequence of components.\n   Findings: The main findings indicate that GA is more effective (best\n   results regarding the fitness function) than HC and RS in the search of\n   solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition\n   for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small\n   instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a\n   context. These SBSE results were complemented by the feedback given by\n   specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity,\n   adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager\n   during the decision making in process composition.\n   Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single\n   company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality\n   restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed\n   to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample\n   prevents generalization for other types of projects or different\n   contexts.\n   Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are\n   facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition,\n   since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process\n   composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by\n   presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes\n   both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through\n   software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the\n   standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions\n   in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile,\n   and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase\n   collaboration in software development.\n   Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage\n   collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it\n   brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on\n   the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area. Finally,\n   this work expands the body of knowledge in SBSE to the field of software\n   process which has not been properly explored by former research. (C)\n   2014 Elsevier Inc.

Applying techniques of\n   spectrum sharing in CR networks can achieve the efficient utilization of\n   network resources. Usually, data rates of user sessions are time varied\n   because of the dynamic behaviors of CR networks. It is expected that the\n   occurrence of link outage should be avoided and incorporated into the\n   routing design under conditions of increasingly crowded spectrum. This\n   paper proposes an integral framework, which considers these two\n   correlated schemes (resource reconfiguration and robust routing)\n   simultaneously. For that, the resource reconfiguration scheme is\n   developed for the efficient usage of network resources and aims at\n   reducing the occupancy of licensed bands. The link outage, resulting\n   from random session rate, is confined within an acceptable range by\n   using strategy of virtual network portfolio'. A robust optimization\n   approach is proposed to guarantee reliable data transmission among\n   possible interfering links.

The evolutionary process of CR network states\n   is provided in simulations, where the results show that the joint design\n   proposal can achieve the least interferences among different licensed\n   users while realizing robust routing.

At the beginning, we have\n   explored the objectives and principles of agile software development.\n   Next, we briefly discussed the BRIDGE process model and further\n   justified that-following BRIDGE process model, the philosophy of agile\n   may also be achieved and conclude that BRIDGE model has both the\n   capability of traditional software development process model as well as\n   of the agile process.}","DOI":"{10.1007/s11334-014-0239-x}","ISSN":"{1614-5046}","EISSN":"{1614-5054}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000357527900001}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000355155100005","entryType":"article","entryTags":{"Author":"Donovan, Pamela S. and Manuj, Ila","Title":"{A Comprehensive Theoretical Model of the Complex Strategic Demand\n   Management Process}","Journal":"{TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL}","Year":"{2015}","Volume":"{54}","Number":"{2}","Pages":"{213-239}","Month":"{SPR}","Abstract":"{This article explains the complex process of strategic demand management\n   by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework that integrates\n   research focused on diverse aspects of demand management such as product\n   characteristics, environmental uncertainties, operational strategies,\n   integration between supply and demand processes, and performance\n   outcomes. Over Inc academic works were synthesized following a\n   structured literature review process. A holistic definition of demand\n   management is presented. Demand management concepts and relationships\n   were investigated and organized in a comprehensive theoretical model.\n   Competitive orientation and strategic consensus emerged as a fundamental\n   construct to understand the demand management process. It was found that\n   consensus among the environment, competitive orientation, and\n   operational strategies supporting demand management would lead to\n   superior performance. Six operational strategies information sharing,\n   integration, inventory, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution-were\n   analyzed with respect to the competitive orientations. This analysis can\n   assist managers in choosing the right portfolio and objectives of the\n   operational strategies to support their demand management goals. The\n   comprehensive demand management framework, six operational strategies\n   and objectives of each operational strategy, and links to performance\n   provides a rich background for conducting empirical research in future.}","ISSN":"{0041-1612}","EISSN":"{2157-328X}","Unique-ID":"{ISI:000355155100005}"}},{"citationKey":"ISI:000351776500008","entryType":"article","entryTags":{"Author":"Laufer, Alexander and Hoffman, Edward J. and Russell, Jeffrey S. and\n   Cameron, Scott W.","Title":"{What Successful Project Managers Do}","Journal":"{MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW}","Year":"{2015}","Volume":"{56}","Number":"{3}","Pages":"{43+}","Month":"{SPR}","Abstract":"{In today's dynamic and competitive world, a project manager's key\n   challenge is coping with frequent unexpected events. Such events can be\n   classified according to their level of predictability as follows: events\n   that were anticipated but whose impacts were much stronger than\n   expected; events that could not have been predicted; and events that\n   could have been predicted but were not. Coping with frequent unexpected\n   events requires an organizational culture that allows the project\n   manager to exercise a great amount of flexibility.\n   The traditional approach to project management emphasizes that project\n   success depends on stability. According to this approach, project\n   success can be achieved by focusing on planning and on controlling and\n   managing risks. Although the popularity of this approach has sharply\n   increased across industries, research covering a wide variety of\n   projects consistently reveals poor performance.\n   The authors collected data from more than 150 successful project\n   managers affiliated with more than 20 organizations and concluded that\n   today's successful project managers cope with unexpected events by a\n   combination of traditional and ``agile{''} approaches to project\n   management. Using business examples drawn from their research at\n   organizations such as Procter \\& Gamble, NASA and the construction\n   services company Boldt, the authors identified four key roles that\n   successful project managers play:\n   The first role, developing collaboration, is performed early on during\n   the project.\n   The second role, integrating planning and review with learning, is\n   performed periodically throughout the project.\n   The third role, preventing major disruptions, is performed occasionally.\n   The fourth role, maintaining forward momentum, is performed\n   continuously.\n   Today's managers must be people-oriented, information-oriented and\n   action-oriented. The authors argue that by assuming the four roles\n   discussed in this article, successful project managers will embrace all\n   three orientations.\n   Reprint 56311.
