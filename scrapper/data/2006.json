If this is so, successful industrial software development should already exhibit agile characteristics. This article therefore aims to examine whether that is the case. It presents an analysis of interviews with software developers from five different companies. We asked about concrete projects, both about the project models and the methods used, but also about the real situation in their daily work. Based on the interviews, we describe and then analyze their development practices. The analysis shows that the software providers we interviewed have more agile practices than they might themselves be aware of. However, plans and more formal development models also are well established. The conclusions answer the question posed in the title: It all depends! It depends on which of the different principles you take to judge agility. And it depends on the characteristics not only of the company but also of the individual project.

In this paper, we describe a case study performed at Sabre Airline SolutionsTM evaluating the effects of adopting Extreme Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study. We identify four factors that potentially impact the outcome of industrial case studies: availability of data, tool support, cooperative personnel and project status. Recognizing and planning for these factors is essential to conducting industrial case studies.

By addressing the important issue of dealing with continuously changing requirements we are faced with panoply of new problems and a genuine need to revisit some principles and classic models of software developments. When it comes to the management of software projects and a way in which we are looking at the software processes and underlying practices, it becomes apparent that in the management practices the issue of uncertainty needs to be quantified and fully addressed. Similarly, it becomes of interest to develop lightweight models of software quality and software processes that are easy to construct and modify as well are transparent to the developer and manager. Given these arguments, in this study we propose logic models based upon the mechanisms of multivalued and fuzzy logic. The realization of such models gives rise to so-called logic networks that are easy to construct, calibrate and interpret.

This problem is made difficult by the complexity of supply chain networks coupled with the complexity of individual manufacturing systems within supply chains. Current systems such as manufacturing execution systems (MES), supply chain management (SCM) systems and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems do not provide adequate facilities for addressing this problem. This paper presents an approach that would enable manufacturing organisations to dynamically and cost-effectively integrate, optimise, configure, simulate, restructure and control not only their own manufacturing systems but also their supply networks, in a co-ordinated manner to cope with the dynamic changes occurring in a global market. This is realised by a synergy of two emerging manufacturing concepts: Agent-based agile manufacturing systems and e-manufacturing. The concept is to represent a complex manufacturing system and its supply network with an agent-based modelling and simulation architecture and to dynamically generate alternative scenarios with respect to planning, scheduling, configuration and restructure of both the manufacturing system and its supply network based on the coordinated interactions amongst agents.

The \\{GRID\\} is capable of detecting and imaging with optimal point spread function gamma-ray photons in the range 30 MeV-30 GeV. The \\{AGILE\\} planned orbit is equatorial, with an altitude of 550 km. This is an optimal orbit from the point of view of the expected particle background. For this orbit, electrons and positrons of kinetic energies between 20 MeV and hundreds of MeV dominate the particle background, with significant contributions from high-energy (primary) and low-energy protons, and gamma-ray albedo-photons. We present here the main results obtained by extensive simulations of the on-board AGILE-GRID particle/photon background rejection algorithms based on a special application of Kalman filter techniques. This filter is applied (Level-2) sequentially after other data processing techniques characterizing the Level-1 processing.

In these circumstances, the challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems with intelligence capabilities, fast adaptation to the environment changes and more robustness against the occurrence of disturbances. This paper presents an agile and adaptive manufacturing control architecture that addresses the need for the fast reaction to disturbances at the shop floor level, increasing the agility and flexibility of the enterprise, when it works in volatile environments. The proposed architecture introduces an adaptive control that balances dynamically between a more centralised structure and a more decentralised one, allowing combining the global production optimisation with agile reaction to unexpected disturbances.

In order to quickly respond to the rapidly changing business environment, agility and interoperability are the main requirements for the VEs. This paper suggests a framework for designing the agile and interoperable VEs. Existing approaches, such as enterprise architecture, model driven architecture, domain specific methodology, meta-modeling, framework-based development, etc., are reviewed, revealing that none offers a complete solution that supports all the aspects of the \\{VE\\} modeling in an elegant manner. Thus, this paper develops a systematic modeling framework by harmonizing these approaches and combining the individual advantages of each approach to produce integrated synergy effects. This modeling framework can be used for business managers or business domain experts to build an agile and interoperable \\{VE\\} quickly and systematically with insights. It also supports a coherent enterprise modeling in which various stakeholders having their own aspects and methodology, such as an \\{IT\\} manager and a business manager, can communicate effectively.

Among the various methodologies or practices proposed, pair programming, which is concerned with two programmers collaborating on design, coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest. Even though some success stories have been reported with the use of pair-programming in real software development environment, many people remain rather skeptical of the claims on pair-programming productivity. Previous studies in pair programming have only addressed the basic understanding of the productivity of pairs and they have not addressed the variation in productivity between pairs of varying skills and experience, such as between novice-novice and expert-expert. Statistical productivity measurements reported by different researchers also seem to lead to contradictory conclusions. Until now, the literature has not addressed how those results and experiments were related to each other. In this paper, we propose a controlled experiment called repeat-programming which can facilitate the understanding of relationships between human experience and programming productivity. Repeat-programming can be performed when controversial issues in non-traditional programming methodologies and development productivity need to be investigated into. To illustrate how the proposed empirical experiment can put arguable, divisive problems into perspective, we have examined the productivity in pair programming as a case study. With repeat-programming, we are able to (i) better understand why results of previous pair programming control experiments reached different conclusions as to the productivity of pair programming and (ii) most importantly, present a case in which novice-novice pairs against novice solos are much more productive than expert-expert pairs against expert solos.

We have articulated a set of circuit design alternatives in terms of switch configurations referred to as symmetric and asymmetric designs, and two-layer and three-layer designs and discuss the implications of these alternatives in terms of transmitter and receiver design and synchronization requirements. In order to evaluate performance and cost of this range of design alternatives, we developed a set of software tools and methodologies for designing and dimensioning our vision of an AAPN. The topological design problem consists of determining the optimal number, size and placement of edge nodes, selector/multiplexers and core switches as well as the placement of the \\{DWDM\\} links so as to minimize network costs while satisfying performance requirements of the supported traffic. A new mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented for core node placement and link connectivity. A methodology has been developed for two-layer and three-layer network topology design and implemented in software. These tools were exercised under a wide variety of equipment cost assumptions for both a metropolitan network and a long-haul network assuming a gravity model for traffic distribution and a flat community of interest factor. Key findings include the determination of near cost optimal designs for both metropolitan (two-layer design) and a Canadian wide area network (WAN, three-layer design). We also show the cost and topology sensitivity to the selector switch size and the preferred size in terms of port count and number of switches.

This attachment is designed as a tripod that provides two rotary motions and one linear motion. The attachment can be mounted onto a variety of machines for different applications, including \\{CNC\\} milling machines, industrial robots, and CMM. Java technologies are used to develop a remote manipulation system for the parallel robotic attachment, including remote monitoring and control. The main difference of this system from the existing web-based or internet-based remote systems is the way to control the motion of the machine from a remote site. Instead of using a camera for monitoring, the tripod is modeled using 3D computer graphics with behavioral control nodes embedded. Compared with camera-based solutions, network traffic is largely reduced, thereby making real-time remote device manipulation practical on the web. Our parallel robotic attachment is one type of parallel kinematic mechanisms (PKM). With \\{PKM\\} emerging as a new way of building flexible systems or agile machines, its advantage over serial mechanism is also presented.

In addition, the existing nonconformance tracking and recovery systems are usually special purpose systems. They lack the capabilities to migrate to new working domains and integrate with other systems. This research proposes a comprehensive approach to nonconformance tracking and recovery. In conjunction with the soft computing and case-based reasoning (CBR) technologies, a generic intelligent system is designed to address the nonconformance tracking and diagnosis problem. A system built under such a comprehensive approach can track the nonconformance with multiple causes as well as limited knowledge and provide timely diagnostic recovery. A prototype of the \\{GINTR\\} system has been developed using the Microsoft .NET technology, which is considered as the next generation distributed computing paradigm. The prototype system developed is generic, fault tolerant, and agile. It can be adapted to diverse complex manufacturing environments with minimum difficulty.
