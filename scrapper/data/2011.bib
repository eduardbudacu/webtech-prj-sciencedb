Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice. Objective Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation. Method The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects. Finally, 60% of respondents would not like to return to the old way of working. Conclusion While the perception of the impact of agile methods is predominantly positive, several challenge areas were discovered. However, based on this study, agile methods are here to stay. "

However, three axis attitude control software is still predominantly based on the conservative use of standard flight proven \{PD\} type controllers, which are known to be limited in terms of rapidity for a prescribed level of energy consumption. Microsatellites are therefore typically not as agile as they could be. This conservatism is due to the complexity of implementing global numerical optimisation techniques to satellite attitude control. In this paper, we consider the model of a low earth orbiting microsatellite with a four wheel configuration, where the speed of one of the wheels is kept constant to provide a momentum bias and guarantee gyroscopic stiffness to disturbances. A geometric optimal control approach is presented, which circumvents the tedious tasks of numerically solving online the nonlinear optimisation problem. The approach is based on the design of suboptimal phase space trajectories. The phase space trajectory of a standard linear controller, typically a \{PD\} law with gyro-compensation, is used as a benchmark. The proposed inverse optimal control technique is then used to enforce higher convergence rate constraints than the benchmark law, without increasing the total energy consumption. The convergence rate of a Lyapunov function under the effect of the optimal controller outperforms the convergence rate of the same function under \{PD\} control and keeps increasing until a design settling time limit is reached. Guidelines are given for the tuning of the controller. The optimal attitude control algorithms are validated on a microsatellite software simulator in collaboration with the space company Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL). The software simulator incorporates a precise model of the effects of estimation errors, noise, external disturbances, sampling and actuator dynamics. The software is similar to the flight software of typical Surrey microsatellites. The proposed techniques are characterised by low implementation complexity because the difficulty is confined to the theoretical design stage. Settling time is significantly enhanced for the same level of energy consumed as the \{PD\} type law, which was used as a benchmark without loss of generality. "

Objective Based on four empirical studies conducted over a 10-year time period from 1999 to 2008 the objective of this paper is to show how the meaning and practice of agile \{ISD\} has evolved over time and on this basis to speculate about what comes next. Method Four phases of research has been conducted, using a grounded theory approach. For each research phase qualitative interviews were held in American and/or Danish companies and a grounded theory was inductively discovered by careful data analysis. Subsequently, the four unique theories have been analyzed for common themes, and a global theory was identified across the empirical data. Results In 1999 companies were developing software at high-speed in a desperate rush to be first-to-market. In 2001 a new high-speed/quick results development process had become established practice. In 2003 changes in the market created the need for a more balanced view on speed and quality, and in 2008 companies were successfully combining agile and plan-driven approaches to achieve the benefits of both. The studies reveal a two-stage pattern in which dramatic changes in the market causes disruption of established practices and process adaptations followed by consolidation of lessons learnt into a once again stable software development process. Conclusion The cyclical history of punctuated process evolution makes it possible to distinguish pre-agility from current practices (agility), and on this basis, to speculate about post-agility: a possible next cycle of software process evolution concerned with proactively pursuing the dual goal of agility and alignment through a diversity of means.

Objective This paper provides an in-depth discussion of the applicability and implications of open innovation in an agile environment. Method We draw on two illustrative cases from industry. Results We highlight some distinct problems that arose when two project teams tried to combine agile and open innovation principles. For example, openness is often compromised by a perceived competitive element and lack of transparency between business units. In addition, minimal documentation often reduce effective knowledge transfer while the use of short iterations, stand-up meetings and presence of on-site customer reduce the amount of time for sharing ideas outside the team.

When embracing agility, important questions must be asked. What precisely is agility and how can it be measured? How can one adopt the appropriate agile enablers to develop agility? How can one effectively assist in enhancing agility? For an enterprise to achieve agility, it is critical to create an effective integrated procedure within the business that coordinates and ensures that the agility providers can satisfy the agility capabilities and cope with drivers, ultimately transforming all of these attributes into strategic competitive edges. However, the existing literature on enterprise agility has failed to sufficiently address the relevant perspectives in such analyzes. The relationship matrix in the quality function deployment (QFD) method provides an excellent tool for deploying important concepts and linking processes. This report suggests a new agility development method for dealing with the interface and alignment issues among the agility drivers, capabilities and providers using the \{QFD\} relationship matrix and fuzzy logic. A fuzzy agility index (FAI) for an enterprise composed of agility capability ratings and a total relation-weight with agility drivers was developed to measure the agility level of an enterprise.

Well-known principles like encapsulating functionality into mechatronic systems to enable reuse and standardization are basic approaches to gain agility in manufacturing environments. However, there is a lack of a holistic communication architecture for manufacturing systems and an overall concept to organize the continuously changing production planning and control processes. The paradigm of service-oriented architectures emerged as a concept to increase the flexibility and reuse within \{IT\} environments by using software modules with standardized communication interfaces. Transferring this paradigm to the field of manufacturing offers a unique opportunity to complement the advances of standardized communication interfaces and mechatronic encapsulation with powerful production planning and control methods. In this paper the central aspects and the potentials of transferring service-oriented paradigms from \{IT\} to automation are discussed. The methodology of process-oriented manufacturing planning is presented as the organizational fundament for an efficient establishment of service-oriented manufacturing systems. An approach for a process-oriented factory model is presented as the basis for a process-oriented planning process. Furthermore, a technical demonstrator that provides the opportunity for evaluating \{SOA\} technologies and our new planning approach is shown. "

Early provider participation is associated with lower change frequencies, while the strength of incentives is less influential. The ease of transforming changes into new projects varies between technologies.

The customer representative is constantly under pressure and may experience difficulties in foreseeing the adequacy of a release plan. Objective To assist release planning in \{XP\} by structuring the planning problem and providing an optimization model that suggests a suitable release plan. Method We develop an optimization model that generates a release plan taking into account story size, business value, possible precedence relations, themes, and uncertainty in velocity prediction. The running-time feasibility is established through computational tests. In addition, we provide a practical heuristic approach to velocity estimation. Results Computational tests show that problems with up to six themes and 50 stories can be solved exactly. An example provides insight into uncertainties affecting velocity, and indicates that the model can be applied in practice. Conclusion An optimization model can be used in practice to enable the customer representative to take more informed decisions faster. This can help adopting \{XP\} in projects where plan-driven approaches have traditionally been used. "

Enterprises are typically comprised of hundreds of applications that are custom built at different times, acquired from third parties and parts of legacy systems, and also operating in multiple tiers of different manufacturing and information system platforms. Further, traceability is characterized by a goal-oriented approach, in which business-process analyses are driven by goal achievements rather than by systematic engineering processes. The use of a classical enterprise integration approach mostly needs tailoring to different applications. Due to the number and diversity of the systems and of their interactions, and to their dynamicity, it is difficult, costly, and therefore often not convenient to develop in large scale distributed systems. To overcome these issues, a supply chain traceability system with a high level of automation is discussed in this paper. In particular, the system adopts an agent-based approach, in which cooperative software agents find solutions to back-end tracing problems by self-organization. Such cooperative agents are based on a business process aware traceability model, and on a service-oriented composition paradigm. Furthermore, an interface agent assists each user to carry out the front-end tracking activities. Interface agents rely on the context-awareness paradigm to gain self-configurability and self-adaptation of the user interface, and on ubiquitous computing technology, i.e., mobile devices and radio-frequency identification, to perform agile and automatic lot identification. The paper comprises real-world experiences on the fashion supply chain. "

A widely accepted way to quantify such losses is by using the “measured mile” approach. This technique compares the productivity achieved during an unimpacted or minimally impacted time period with productivity realized during an impacted period. The dependability of the periods that are chosen is vital and plays a key role in the determination of merit, liability and quantum. The work performed during the measured mile period should be substantially similar to the work that was affected. As currently practiced though, choosing the periods for measured mile analysis is usually made in a largely subjective manner. The objective of this article is to introduce and illustrate the statistical clustering method as a tool for selecting the similar working periods. This new approach is advocated because it determines similarity of work condition using objective criteria. The method is agile and can be easily applied in practice by project managers or construction consultants. In this paper the factors that affect the similarity of work are identified, and the clustering procedure is developed. An example is also included to show how the method works in practice. "

However, given the stochastic nature of the faults, plant equipments and machines usually fail unexpectedly, before the scheduled maintenance action. Therefore, condition based maintenance (CBM) has been introduced, without any fixed interval length between the maintenance actions, as a more efficient maintenance policy. A technique developed for condition based maintenance of electro-mechanical systems is electrical signature analysis. The basic idea behind electrical signature analysis is that, time-dependent load and speed variations in an electro-mechanical system generally induce correlated small variations in the system's electrical response. Electrical signature analysis analyzes these small variations providing diagnostic information. A tool based on this technique is agile in its adoption since no specific sensors must be installed on the machine, but only power signal must be measured and thus the implementation of such tool can be considered simple and flexible. This paper presents a tool that has such kind of characteristics. The tool processes power signals acquired by transducers installed on the electrical lines of electro-mechanical systems, for machine fault diagnosis. The data acquired are processed through some steps, using some signal indicators developed to understand the machine behaviour. "

On the other hand, the flexibility in the spectrum access phase comes with an increased complexity in the design of communication protocols at different layers. This work focuses on the problem of designing effective routing solutions for multi-hop CRNs, which is a focal issue to fully unleash the potentials of the cognitive networking paradigm.

abstract = "Information Technology (IT) infrastructure integration and knowledge management (KM) share communal objectives e.g. to transform organisations into more effective and efficient, agile and innovative, and more responsive to market changes. Such an association when assimilates bona fide knowledge management philosophy, it offers the \{IT\} departments a headship opportunity for organisational transformation in correlation with the rest of the organisation. Despite more than a decade of active research and practice in this complex problem area, advocates still perceive that Local Government Authorities (LGAs) lack integrated \{IT\} infrastructures that have resulted in the generation of data inconsistencies and redundancies, inefficient knowledge exchange and reduction in service quality and delivery. In the recent years, several \{LGAs\} have implemented Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) solutions to integrate their \{IT\} infrastructure. However, on analysing the relevant research studies, it is noticeable that application of \{EAI\} has been practiced at a larger scale in the private domain but to limited scale in the public domain. The shortage of such research studies presents a knowledge gap that needs to be endorsed. This research adapts a Revised Model for Integration Layers (REAL). By adapting to this model, it is exemplified that \{EAI\} achieves integration at five layers namely: connectivity, transportation, transformation, process integration and knowledge integration. The methodology for validating this model included a qualitative analysis of data gathered from formal interviews, observations and archive documents guided by initial conceptual observations from the literature. The findings indicate that cases leading to data inconsistencies and replication can be prevented by integrating knowledge through EAI. "

This proposed system is expected to have a significant impact on the performance of logistics networks by virtue of its capabilities to adapt unexpected supply and demand changes in the volatile marketplace with the unique feature of responsiveness with the advanced technology, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Recent studies have found that \{RFID\} and artificial intelligence techniques drive the development of total solution in logistics industry. Apart from tracking the movement of the goods, \{RFID\} is able to play an important role to reflect the inventory level of various distribution areas. In today’s globalized industrial environment, the physical logistics operations and the associated flow of information are the essential elements for companies to realize an efficient logistics workflow scenario. Basically, a flexible logistics workflow, which is characterized by its fast responsiveness in dealing with customer requirements through the integration of various value chain activities, is fundamental to leverage business performance of enterprises. The significance of this research is the demonstration of the synergy of using a combination of advanced technologies to form an integrated system that helps achieve lean and agile logistics workflow.

abstract = "The global industry is currently facing a growing increase in the competitiveness that forces companies to adopt and develop new strategies and methods of production. Therefore, one of the most relevant challenges in manufacturing engineering is innovatively integrating Product, Process and Factory dimensions and life cycles, in a holistic approach, from design to recycling/disposal and reuse. The challenge faced here is the synchronization and simultaneous generation of all three-domain models by integrating manufacturing engineering knowledge into the early stage of the modelling and planning processes. The next generation of factories has to be modular, scalable, flexible, open, agile and knowledge-based in order to be able to adapt, in real time, to the continuously changing market demands, technology options and regulations. Therefore, integration, flexibility and efficiency requirements and the ability to simulate the production life cycle of a factory play a crucial role in decreasing ramp-up and design times. Furthermore they play a crucial role in improving the performance in the evaluation and reconfiguration of new or existing facilities, in supporting management decisions and providing tools that can guarantee real-time performance monitoring. Therefore, it is necessary to research and implement the underlying models and ideas during the foundation stage of a new conceptual framework, which is designed to be implemented in the next generation of factories. This will be supported by suitable Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and digital infrastructures and should lay down the foundations for future applications in this research area—the industrial paradigm of “Factory as a Product”. In line with the context presented here, we propose the development of factory templates to address the design and operation practices throughout the entire life cycle of the factory. Different dimensions of the factory templates are presented in this paper; they cover the design and creation of the factory, its remodelling and even the disassembly and recycling stages. This entire study takes into account relevant factors such as costs, quality, time, flexibility, environmental and social issues and energy efficiency. Throughout the article, different kinds of models are presented, which describe and adjust the structure of the analysis, design and development of a factory integration project that helps provide a formal analysis of the system. Furthermore, templates integrating the factory's response to internal and external disturbances will also be developed. "

The integrated simulator of shipboard crane was realized by cooperating a component of external force interface routine and fluid analysis software. A transfer control system is conducted by \{HSA\} (Hybrid Shape Approach) using \{STT\} (Straight Transfer Transformation) method and its effectiveness in suppressing the sway of both ship and load was confirmed by the simulation analysis. A shipboard crane operational training system which we call virtual coach teaching system, is also presented, in order to shorten the training period of amateur operators. The controlled inputs generated from \{HSA\} controller which are utilized as the ideal commands are then converted to drive a newly built teaching interface. Subjects are physically coached through the ideal motion of joystick by placing their hand on the teaching interface, thus giving them a kinesthetic understanding on how to transfer a load without exciting the sway of both the ship and load. Performance of subjects was measured in terms of transfer time by conducting an experiment using a newly built virtual driving simulator. Findings from this study indicate that virtual coach teaching is effective in training. "

To reduce online computation time, dynamically-feasible trajectories will be generated in real-time from a library of pre-specified maneuvers, with the sequence of maneuvers to be traversed determined by a heuristic search algorithm which incorporates some features of greedy search along with effective backtracking. Linearizing the nonlinear system equations about the library maneuvers results in a hybrid linear time-varying model. The paper provides an optimal control algorithm, with the ℓ2-induced norm as the performance measure, for such a hybrid model, which ensures that the system tracks the desired trajectory as accurately as possible despite various disturbances and uncertainties. The paper also compares the performance of the developed motion planning algorithm to that of dynamically weighted A*. "
