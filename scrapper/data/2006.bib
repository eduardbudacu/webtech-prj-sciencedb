If this is so, successful industrial software development should already exhibit agile characteristics. This article therefore aims to examine whether that is the case. It presents an analysis of interviews with software developers from five different companies. We asked about concrete projects, both about the project models and the methods used, but also about the real situation in their daily work. Based on the interviews, we describe and then analyze their development practices. The analysis shows that the software providers we interviewed have more agile practices than they might themselves be aware of. However, plans and more formal development models also are well established. The conclusions answer the question posed in the title: It all depends! It depends on which of the different principles you take to judge agility. And it depends on the characteristics not only of the company but also of the individual project. "

These methods have evolved a set of shared component techniques. In this paper we show how these techniques can be combined in countless ways to create needs-specific methods in an agile way. We demonstrate the generality of these techniques by describing a new architecture improvement method called \{APTIA\} (Analytic Principles and Tools for the Improvement of Architectures). \{APTIA\} almost entirely reuses pre-existing techniques but in a new combination, with new goals and results. We exemplify APTIA’s use in improving the architecture of a commercial information system. "

We compare the team’s business-related results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study.

When it comes to the management of software projects and a way in which we are looking at the software processes and underlying practices, it becomes apparent that in the management practices the issue of uncertainty needs to be quantified and fully addressed. Similarly, it becomes of interest to develop lightweight models of software quality and software processes that are easy to construct and modify as well are transparent to the developer and manager. Given these arguments, in this study we propose logic models based upon the mechanisms of multivalued and fuzzy logic. The realization of such models gives rise to so-called logic networks that are easy to construct, calibrate and interpret. "

Agile enterprise whereby an organization can change and adapt quickly to changing circumstances is increasingly viewed as a winning strategy. However, in embracing agile enterprise, there are important questions to be asked: what precisely is agility and how can it be measured? How can one assist in achieving and enhancing agility effectively? Answers to such questions are critical to the practitioners and to the theory of agile enterprise design. The foundation of agile enterprise lies in the integration of information system/technologies, people, business processes and facilities. Due to the ill-defined and vague indicators which exist within agility assessment, most measures are described subjectively by linguistic terms which are characterized by ambiguity and multi-possibility, and the conventional assessment approaches cannot suitably nor effectively handle such measurement. However, fuzzy logic provides a useful tool for dealing with decisions in which the phenomena are imprecise and vague. Thus, the novelty in the paper is development of the absolute agility index, a unique and unprecedented attempt in agility measurement, using fuzzy logic to address the ambiguity in agility evaluation. Details of the approach and a framework of a fuzzy agility evaluation will be presented. An example is also used to illustrate the approach developed. "

The focus of this paper is specifically on the content of the work carried out, along with the main benefits and results. Key to achieving the goals is following a complete project-life-cycle path from the initial stages where the industrial users requirements were identified and the system specification took place to the development and tuning of the final system. Design choices for software must strike a balance between the user flexibility required and the representing environment constraints, i.e. finite capacity scheduling, which takes production requirements from existing production planning systems, to schedule production resources like plant workers, critical tools and machines. The system consists of a material optimiser working closely with the finite capacity scheduler and a dynamic scheduler providing automatic reaction to real-time exceptions, thus deriving in solutions of higher performance.

This paper presents an approach that would enable manufacturing organisations to dynamically and cost-effectively integrate, optimise, configure, simulate, restructure and control not only their own manufacturing systems but also their supply networks, in a co-ordinated manner to cope with the dynamic changes occurring in a global market. This is realised by a synergy of two emerging manufacturing concepts: Agent-based agile manufacturing systems and e-manufacturing. The concept is to represent a complex manufacturing system and its supply network with an agent-based modelling and simulation architecture and to dynamically generate alternative scenarios with respect to planning, scheduling, configuration and restructure of both the manufacturing system and its supply network based on the coordinated interactions amongst agents.

In particular, we started to evaluate the effects of \{TDD\} (Test Driven Development) since it is easer to apply in a distributed environment than most other agile practices. In order to reach this goal we used the simulation modeling approach. We developed a simulation model of open source software development process. The model was tuned using data from a real \{FLOSS\} project: Apache \{HTTP\} Server. To introduce the \{TDD\} practice in our \{FLOSS\} simulation model, we made some assumptions based on empirical results. The two \{FLOSS\} development models (nonTDD and TDD) were compared. The one incorporating the agile practice yields better results in terms of code quality. "

We present in this paper a discussion of the method and main simulation results of the on-board background filter of the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) of the \{AGILE\} mission. The \{GRID\} is capable of detecting and imaging with optimal point spread function gamma-ray photons in the range 30 MeV–30 GeV. The \{AGILE\} planned orbit is equatorial, with an altitude of 550 km. This is an optimal orbit from the point of view of the expected particle background. For this orbit, electrons and positrons of kinetic energies between 20 MeV and hundreds of MeV dominate the particle background, with significant contributions from high-energy (primary) and low-energy protons, and gamma-ray albedo-photons. We present here the main results obtained by extensive simulations of the on-board AGILE-GRID particle/photon background rejection algorithms based on a special application of Kalman filter techniques. This filter is applied (Level-2) sequentially after other data processing techniques characterizing the Level-1 processing. We show that, in conjunction with the Level-1 processing, the adopted Kalman filtering is expected to reduce the total particle/albedo-photon background rate to a value ( ⩽ 10 – 30 Hz ) that is compatible with the \{AGILE\} telemetry. The \{AGILE\} on-board Kalman filter is also effective in reducing the Earth–albedo-photon background rate, and therefore contributes to substantially increase the \{AGILE\} exposure for celestial gamma-ray sources.

Among the various methodologies or practices proposed, pair programming, which is concerned with two programmers collaborating on design, coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest. Even though some success stories have been reported with the use of pair-programming in real software development environment, many people remain rather skeptical of the claims on pair-programming productivity. Previous studies in pair programming have only addressed the basic understanding of the productivity of pairs and they have not addressed the variation in productivity between pairs of varying skills and experience, such as between novice–novice and expert–expert. Statistical productivity measurements reported by different researchers also seem to lead to contradictory conclusions. Until now, the literature has not addressed how those results and experiments were related to each other. In this paper, we propose a controlled experiment called repeat-programming which can facilitate the understanding of relationships between human experience and programming productivity. Repeat-programming can be performed when controversial issues in non-traditional programming methodologies and development productivity need to be investigated into. To illustrate how the proposed empirical experiment can put arguable, divisive problems into perspective, we have examined the productivity in pair programming as a case study. With repeat-programming, we are able to (i) better understand why results of previous pair programming control experiments reached different conclusions as to the productivity of pair programming and (ii) most importantly, present a case in which novice–novice pairs against novice solos are much more productive than expert–expert pairs against expert solos.

We have articulated a set of circuit design alternatives in terms of switch configurations referred to as symmetric and asymmetric designs, and two-layer and three-layer designs and discuss the implications of these alternatives in terms of transmitter and receiver design and synchronization requirements. In order to evaluate performance and cost of this range of design alternatives, we developed a set of software tools and methodologies for designing and dimensioning our vision of an AAPN. The topological design problem consists of determining the optimal number, size and placement of edge nodes, selector/multiplexers and core switches as well as the placement of the \{DWDM\} links so as to minimize network costs while satisfying performance requirements of the supported traffic. A new mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented for core node placement and link connectivity. A methodology has been developed for two-layer and three-layer network topology design and implemented in software. These tools were exercised under a wide variety of equipment cost assumptions for both a metropolitan network and a long-haul network assuming a gravity model for traffic distribution and a flat community of interest factor. Key findings include the determination of near cost optimal designs for both metropolitan (two-layer design) and a Canadian wide area network (WAN, three-layer design). We also show the cost and topology sensitivity to the selector switch size and the preferred size in terms of port count and number of switches. "

Smart targets are targets that can detect when they are under surveillance and react in a manner that makes future surveillance more difficult. We take a reinforcement learning approach to adaptively schedule a multi-modality sensor so as to most quickly and effectively detect the presence of smart targets and track them as they travel through a surveillance region. An optimal scheduling strategy, which would simultaneously address the issue of target detection and tracking, is very challenging computationally. To avoid this difficulty, we use a two stage approach where targets are first detected and then handed off to a tracking algorithm. We investigate algorithms capable of choosing whether to use the active or passive mode of an agile sensor. The active mode is easily detected by the target, which makes the target prefer to move into hide mode. The passive mode is nearly undetectable to the target. However, the active mode has substantially better detection and tracking capabilities then the passive mode. Using this setup, we characterize the advantage of a non-myopic policy with respect to myopic and random polices for multitarget detection and tracking. "
