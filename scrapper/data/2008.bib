A systematic review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and situations. "

Agile software engineering methods have recently emerged as a new and different way of developing software as compared to the traditional methodologies. However, their success has mostly been anecdotal, and research in this subject is still scant in the academic circles. This research study was a survey study on the critical success factors of Agile software development projects using quantitative approach. Based on existing literature, a preliminary list of potential critical success factors of Agile projects were identified and compiled. Subsequently, reliability analysis and factor analysis were conducted to consolidate this preliminary list into a final set of 12 possible critical success factors for each of the four project success categories – Quality, Scope, Time, and Cost. A survey was conducted among Agile professionals, gathering survey data from 109 Agile projects from 25 countries across the world. Multiple regression techniques were used, both at the full regression model and at the optimized regression model via the stepwise screening procedure. The results revealed that only 10 out of 48 hypotheses were supported, identifying three critical success factors for Agile software development projects: (a) Delivery Strategy, (b) Agile Software Engineering Techniques, and (c) Team Capability. Limitations of the study are discussed together with interpretations for practitioners. To ensure success of their projects, managers are urged to focus on choosing a high-caliber team, practicing Agile engineering techniques and following Agile-style delivery strategy. "

Key characteristics of agile methods are lean and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. \{PLE\} leverages reuse through systematic approaches such as variability modeling or product derivation. Integrating agile approaches with product line engineering is an interesting proposition which – not surprisingly – entails several challenges: Product lines (PL) rely on complex plans and models to ensure their long-term evolution while agile methods emphasize simplicity and short-term value-creation for customers. When incorporating agility in product line engineering, it is thus essential to define carefully how agile principles can support particular \{PLE\} processes. For instance, the processes of defining and setting up a product line (domain engineering) and deriving products (application engineering) differ significantly in practices and focus with implications on the suitability of agile principles. This paper presents practical experiences of adopting agile principles in product line planning (a domain engineering activity). ThinkLets, i.e., collaborative practices from the area of collaboration engineering, are the building blocks of the presented approach as they codify agile principles such as stakeholder involvement, rapid feedback, or value-based prioritization. We discuss how our approach balances agility and the intrinsic needs of product line planning. A case study carried out with an industrial partner indicates that the approach is practicable, usable, and useful. "

Although they follow different approaches to achieve it, some synergies can be found between them by (i) applying agile techniques to \{SPL\} activities so \{SPL\} development becomes more agile; and (ii) tailoring agile methodologies to support the development of SPL. Both options require an intensive use of feature models, which are usually strongly affected by changes on requirements. Changing large-scale feature models as a consequence of changes on requirements is a well-known error-prone activity. Since one of the objectives of agile methods is a rapid response to changes in requirements, it is essential an automated error analysis support in order to make \{SPL\} development more agile and to produce error-free feature models. As a contribution to find the intended synergies, this article sets the basis to provide an automated support to feature model error analysis by means of a framework which is organized in three levels: a feature model level, where the problem of error treatment is described; a diagnosis level, where an abstract solution that relies on Reiter’s theory of diagnosis is proposed; and an implementation level, where the abstract solution is implemented by using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). To show an application of our proposal, a real case study is presented where the Feature-Driven Development (FDD) methodology is adapted to develop an SPL. Current proposals on error analysis are also studied and a comparison among them and our proposal is provided. Lastly, the support of new kinds of errors and different implementation levels for the proposed framework are proposed as the focus of our future work. "

The use of these web services in the development process of \{WSbWAs\} can help overcome many problems of software use, deployment and evolution. Although the cost-effective software engineering of \{WSbWAs\} is potentially a very rewarding area, not much work has been done to accomplish short time to market conditions by viewing and dealing with \{WSbWAs\} as software products that can be derived from a common infrastructure and assets with a captured specific abstraction in the domain. Both Product Line Engineering (PLE) and Agile Methods (AMs), albeit with different philosophies, are software engineering approaches that can significantly shorten the time to market and increase the quality of products. Using the \{PLE\} approach we built, at the domain engineering level, a WSbWA-specific lightweight product-line architecture and combined it, at the application engineering level, with an Agile Method that uses a domain-specific visual language with direct manipulation and extraction capabilities of web services to perform customization and calibration of a product or \{WSBWA\} for a specific customer. To assess the effectiveness of our approach we designed and implemented a tool that we used to investigate the return on investment of the activities related to \{PLE\} and AMs. Details of our proposed approach, the related tool developed, and the experimental study performed are presented in this article together with a discussion of planned directions of future work.

A modified version of the genetic algorithm, inspired by the particle swarm optimization approach, is applied to the problem in addition to the general application of genetic algorithms. The objective is to investigate the potential that the particle swarm optimization concepts may have in improving the performance of genetic algorithms when applied to the chosen problem. The performance of these algorithms is compared to existing heuristics in the literature. A 23 factorial experiment, replicated twice, is used to compare the performance of the various approaches and identify the significant factors that affect the average percentage deviation from a lower bound. The results show that both versions of genetic algorithms applications outperform the existing heuristics in many instances and provide schedules that are shorter by as much as 15.5% in the cases considered. In addition, the modified application of genetic algorithms outperforms the regular application with shorter schedules by as much as 3.6% in many instances. "

In this paper, we analyse the structure and use of story cards and the Wall in three mature \{XP\} teams, using a distributed cognition approach. The teams work in different commercial organisations developing different systems, yet we find significant similarities between their use of these two artefacts. Although simple, teams use the cards and the Wall in sophisticated ways to represent and communicate information that is vital to support their activities.

As a main actor of the enterprise integration, manufacturing control systems should be designed in order to answer these necessities of reactivity and profitability in a flexible way. Holonic manufacturing system (HMS) proposes a structure organized as a loosely coupled network of communicating and cooperating agents to solve this problem. Such approach offers concrete solutions to reconfigurability and evolvability issues of manufacturing control systems. This paper presents a manufacturing execution system (MES), using the \{HMS\} concepts, and illustrates this approach on a real industrial application.11American Glass Product (AGP; www.agpglass.com) supports and partially finances this project. Such a structure is based on a typology of manufacturing system elements (products, resources, orders). Roles and behaviours for these manufacturing control elements are proposed. Product holons own reference models of products, for manufacturing execution and quality control. Resources holons are components used as bricks with local intelligent decision-making system embedded. Based on characteristics of the tasks they perform, a specialisation of resource holons is proposed. Specific heuristics are suggested for each class of resource holon. Finally, order holons are related to product demand, manufacturing task and product item. They own models of product item and a time model of the manufacturing task. Mechanisms are proposed to synchronize the execution of manufacturing tasks. These mechanisms guarantee the availability of components and enable to impose time constraints on task scheduling. This \{MES\} implements a product-centred approach, as shown by the active and opportunistic behaviour of order holons. "

Such a process-oriented view of methodologies, based on the metaphor that human organizations are “machines” that “execute” processes, often results in methodologies that are too rigid and hard to follow, and most often than not end up being ignored or bypassed. Our proposal here is that, since the ultimate aim of software development is to provide a software product, software development methodologies should be described in terms of the intermediate products that are necessary to reach such a final product, plus the needed micro-processes that, as necessary evils, will be required to produce the appropriate work products from other, previously created ones. Using this product-oriented approach, software development methodologies can be specified that are, at least, as flexible as lightweight, agile approaches and, at the same time, as powerful and scalable as plan-oriented ones.

Caring for the transplant patients in the hospital setting, right after the patient is moved from the intensive care unit to the ward, is one of the most challenging tasks in nursing. It involves many procedures, rigid protocols, tight monitoring, and intensive data gathering for use by the other coordinating healthcare professionals. The complexity is further increased when a nurse has to take care of several transplant patients in a single shift. Of late, there has been a growth of computer applications in nursing and clinical information systems. Their acceptability and usability determine the ultimate success of computer support for this complex task. In this paper, we present a case study in which we combine two well-known software engineering techniques—namely, agile programming and user centered design—toward the goal of developing an interactive system for supporting the activities of transplant nurses in a hospital setting. This has resulted in a usable end-product and the user centered approach has motivated the nurses to move towards the use of computers in their jobs for better productivity. The product’s usability was formally evaluated and is reported herein. The strengths and limitations of this approach are also discussed. The software product developed has been well accepted and is currently being planned to replace the manual methods followed in the transplant ward of a large metropolitan hospital. "

Thus, this chapter provides a history of electronic computers, electronic commerce, software methods, software quality metrics, agile methods and studies on agile methods. None of these histories are without controversy. For instance, some scholars begin the study of the electronic computer by mentioning the emergence of the Sumerian text, Hammurabi code or the abacus. We, however, will align our history with the emergence of the modern electronic computer at the beginning of World War II. The history of electronic commerce also has poorly defined beginnings. Some studies of electronic commerce begin with the widespread use of the Internet in the early 1990s. However, electronic commerce cannot be appreciated without establishing a deeper context. Few scholarly studies, if any, have been performed on agile methods, which is the basic purpose of this literature review. That is, to establish the context to conduct scholarly research within the fields of agile methods and electronic commerce. "

Using empirical data, we find a domino effect among \{IT\} integration, supply chain flexibility, supply chain agility, and competitive business performance. Results from this study indicate that \{IT\} integration enables a firm to tap its supply chain flexibility which in turn results in higher supply chain agility and ultimately higher competitive business performance.

The lead programmer/IT member of the product team manages this somewhat agile development team, which will engage in test-driven development. The financial engineers from the product team over the course of Stage 3 manage software quality assurance of business tier software. The traders from the product team perform and/or oversee quality assurance over GUI, integration, and reporting mechanisms, as well as run user-acceptance tests. The marketing person from the product team writes or oversees the writing of the user documentation for the software. Addition of a risk manager, who will learn the specifics of the trading/investment system and be able to recommend how best to build out the risk management functions and reporting requirements, is also recommended. A development team develops software iteratively, and this iterative development dramatically increases feedback versus sequential development, providing closer communication between the product team and the development team.

Recent advances in optical header (label) processing and optical switching led to asynchronous and variable-length \{OPS\} with contention resolution in wavelength, time, and space domains at nanosecond switching speeds. Unlike electronic packet switching routers, optical routers can exploit the wavelength domain to greatly reduce the buffer requirement and to discard store-and-buffer architecture involving packet processing in the data plane. A description is given of the networking architecture/protocols, systems, and technologies pertaining to optical burst and packet switching. Optical label switching technology is introduced, which provides a unified platform for interoperating optical circuit, burst, and packet switching techniques. In addition to the reduced complexity and power requirements in optical label switching (OLS) routers resulting from significantly reduced high-speed electronic processing in the data plane, further advances in integrated optoelectronic technologies may eventually allow chip-scale integration of \{OLS\} routers for the agile, robust, and high-performance Internet in the future.

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter presents an incremental development methodology of trading and investment system, which would ensure a rapid development cycle with quick deliverables and consistent quality standards. However, before the beginning of development methodology, the product team has to raise money to fund the development and to raise money, a product team needs a Money Document. Trading and money management is a business and in order to succeed, product teams need to raise research and development capital as well as trading capital, from either inside the firm or outside it. A well-done Money Document serves as a Vision and Scope Document by outlining the business goals of a proposed trading/investment system in a clear and concise fashion in order to persuade management or outside investors to provide the initial capital needed for research and subsequently for development of a trading/investment system according to the four-stage methodology. The resources allocated to a project, subsequent to the delivery of a Money Document and management approval, enables the process of development methodology. The methodology combines the various aspects of well-known methodologies such as the traditional waterfall of Royce and spiral methodology of Boehm from software, the Stage-Gate ® methodology of Cooper from new product development, and Lean, Six Sigma, and Agile development. The Royce's traditional waterfall methodology for software development consists of four stages that include analysis, design, implementation, and testing that vaguely map to the four stages of the methodology. By using the waterfall methodology, the teams avoid the pitfalls of creating systems before project plans are precisely defined and approved. In the spiral methodology, a smaller amount of time is initially devoted to the four stages that include research, planning, implementation, and testing, which are followed by several iterations or loops over each.

abstract = "With the recent advent of agile software process methods, a number of seldom used and unorthodox practices have come to the forefront in the field of computer programming. One such practice is that of pair programming, which is characterized by two programmers sharing the same computer for collaborative programming purposes. The very nature of pair programming implies a psychological and social interaction between the participating programmers and thus brings into play a unique element that we do not see with the conventional individual programming model. This paper focuses on the effects that one of these psychosocial factors, a programmer’s personality type, may have on the pair programming environment. In this study, a group of university students, 68 undergraduate students and 60 master’s degree graduate students, each of whom had been personality type profiled using the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) model, was split into three sub-groups. One group consisted of subjects who were alike in \{MBTI\} type. Another group consisted of subjects who were opposite to each other in \{MBTI\} type, and the last group was comprised of subjects who were diverse – partially alike and partially opposite – in \{MBTI\} type. Through two pair programming sessions, the pairs in each group were assessed for their output, in code productivity. The result showed that the sub-group of subjects who were diverse in \{MBTI\} type exhibited higher productivity than both alike and opposite groups. In a comparison between alike and opposite groups, the productivity of the opposite group was greater than that of the alike group. "

The advances in \{CNC\} technology coupled with enhancements in computing systems have provided the basis to re-examine the way in which computer-aided systems (CAx) can be used to enable global manufacturing. Interoperability of the various components of the \{CAx\} chain is therefore a major prerequisite for manufacturing enterprises for becoming strategically agile and consequently globally competitive. Being interoperable, resources can be utilized interchangeably in a plug-and-produce manner. Over the last 8 years the eminence of a \{STEP\} standard for machining entitled STEP-NC (numerical control) has become a well-known vehicle for research to improve the level of information availability at the \{CNC\} machine tool. In this paper, the authors introduce the background to the evolution of \{CNC\} manufacturing over the last 50 years and the current standards available for programming. A review of the literature in interoperable \{CNC\} manufacturing is then provided relating to milling, turn–mill and other \{NC\} processes. The major part of the paper provides a strategic view of how interoperability can be implemented across the \{CAx\} chain with a range of standards used to regulate the flow of information. Finally, the paper outlines the advantages and major issues for future developments in interoperability, identifying future key requirements and limiting factors. "

To support the rapidly changing data requirements of agile companies, conceptual data models, which constitute the foundation of database design, should be sufficiently flexible to be able to incorporate changes easily and smoothly. In order to understand what factors drive the maintainability of conceptual data models and to improve conceptual modelling processes, we need to be able to assess conceptual data model properties and qualities in an objective and cost-efficient manner. The scarcity of early available and thoroughly validated maintainability measurement instruments motivated us to define a set of metrics for Entity–Relationship (ER) diagrams. In this paper we show that these easily calculated and objective metrics, measuring structural properties of \{ER\} diagrams, can be used as indicators of the understandability of the diagrams. Understandability is a key factor in determining maintainability as model modifications must be preceded by a thorough understanding of the model. The validation of the metrics as early understandability indicators opens up the way for an in-depth study of how structural properties determine conceptual data model understandability. It also allows building maintenance-related prediction models that can be used in conceptual data modelling practice. "

Dynamic simulation approach has been one of the activities among other product process re-engineering efforts in the company. This paper describes the approach and “Product Process Decision Simulation” (PPDS) solution as the first implemented application of the approach. A dynamic model of product development has been created and applied to manage product process complex dynamic behavior on system level in order to reduce product development cycle times, slippages and costs as well as improve perceived product quality. The key contribution of the simulation solution is to provoke facilitated discussion in order to gain shared understanding of interdependencies and dynamic causes and effects in product process.

Many look to deal quickly with disturbances, reduce inventory, and exchange information promptly throughout the supply chain. In other words they want to become more agile. To reach this objective it is critical for planning systems to present planning strategies adapted to the different contexts, to attain better performances. Due to consolidation, the development of integrated supply chains and the use of inter-organizational information systems have increased business interdependencies and in turn the need for increased collaboration to deal with disturbance in a synchronized way. Thus, agility and synchronization in supply chains are critical to maintain overall performance. In order to develop tools to increase the agility of the supply chain and to promote the collaborative management of such disturbances, agent-based technology takes advantage of the ability of agents to make autonomous decisions in a distributed network through the use of advanced collaboration mechanisms. Moreover, because of the highly instable and dynamic environment of today's supply chains, planning agents must handle multiple problem solving approaches. This paper proposes a Multi-behavior planning agent model using different planning strategies when decisions are supported by a distributed planning system. The implementation of this solution is realized through the FOR@C experimental agent-based platform, dedicated to supply chain planning for the lumber industry. "

In the early 1990s, agile manufacturing (AM) gained momentum and received due attention from both researchers and practitioners. In the mid-1990s, \{SCM\} began to attract interest. Both \{AM\} and \{SCM\} appear to differ in philosophical emphasis, but each complements the other in objectives for improving organizational competitiveness. For example, \{AM\} relies more on strategic alliances/partnerships (virtual enterprise environment) to achieve speed and flexibility. But the issues of cost and the integration of suppliers and customers have not been given due consideration in AM. By contrast, cost is given a great deal of attention in SCM, which focuses on the integration of suppliers and customers to achieve an integrated value chain with the help of information technologies and systems. Considering the significance of both \{AM\} and \{SCM\} for firms to improve their performance, an attempt has been made in this paper to analyze both \{AM\} and \{SCM\} with the objective of developing a framework for responsive supply chain (RSC). We compare their characteristics and objectives, review the selected literature, and analyze some case experiences on \{AM\} and SCM, and develop an integrated framework for a RSC. The proposed framework can be employed as a competitive strategy in a networked economy in which customized products/services are produced with virtual organizations and exchanged using e-commerce.

In the nineties Ethernet-based technologies have been successfully introduced to office automation followed by the usage of Internet-based applications. Today industrial automation is getting penetrated by the same \{IT\} technologies used in office automation. Nevertheless, the factory floor, respectively automation science and practice, has special requirements that clearly differ from IT-world requirements; this especially concerns safety, security, real-time, wireless and public network integration aspects. Thus – to make information technologies applicable in all fields of production industries – these technologies have to be adopted, extended or even modified. This significant challenge is extensively tackled by the European Integrated Project “Virtual Automation Networks”. The exchange of the industrial automation network base towards \{IT\} technologies also offers the unique change to build an open network platform providing easy integration and extendibility capabilities. This paper presents the open system architecture and first implementation steps for realizing a Virtual Automation Network. The concepts aimed at are characterized by modularity and intelligence, thus, enabling flexibility and re-configurability focusing on future knowledge-based and agile manufacturing enterprises. "

abstract = "Smart and sustainable campuses demand three components. First, there is the need to have a Strategic Master Plan (SMP) for all infrastructures that include energy, transportation, water, waste and telecommunications along with the traditional dimensions of research, curricula, outreach and assessments. Secondarily, there is the array of issues pertaining to the sitting of buildings and overall facility master planning which must be addressed from the perspective of “green” energy, efficient orientation and be designed for multiple-use by the academic and local community. Thirdly, the development of sustainable buildings in one area that is compact and walkable campuses thus enable a range of transportation choices leads to reduced energy consumption. Historically, college campuses were often like towns and villages in that they are self-sustaining for family, business and recreational activities. Any sustainable smart campus is a vibrant, “experiential” applied educational model that should catalyze creative learning. More significantly, today, campuses and communities must be secure in terms of not only their own energy use and needs, but also for the resource demands of their power. Otherwise, the community(s) will never be secure economically or politically. Recognizing global warming and climate change, in the spring of 2001, the Board of Trustee (BOT) for the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) took the critical initial policy steps to turn these sustainable developments into goals. For example, the \{LACCD\} decided to have new “green” buildings to replace or renovate existing ones. The building program led to sustainable communities that included recycling, product reuse from waste as well as smart growth in terms of reduced energy use, efficiency and the use of telecommunication and wireless systems. The paper focuses primarily on the energy programs for the \{LACCD\} campuses. The paper considers the overall energy situation in California and the Southern California region, primarily Los Angeles. Then the paper looks at the state and regional energy contexts which lay the ground work and rationale why \{LACCD\} and other communities must act on their own to counteract climate change and global warming. Finally, the paper discusses how a community becomes sustainable, and hence “energy independent”. By doing so, any community can generate its own energy through the production or acquisition of its energy from renewable sources such as solar, wind or biomass among other local resources. Even more significant consequences come in terms of carbon control, lower impact on the environment and reduced global warming. "
