Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice. Objective Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation. Method The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects. Finally, 60% of respondents would not like to return to the old way of working. Conclusion While the perception of the impact of agile methods is predominantly positive, several challenge areas were discovered. However, based on this study, agile methods are here to stay.

Horri and P. Palmer and M.

However, three axis attitude control software is still predominantly based on the conservative use of standard flight proven \\{PD\\} type controllers, which are known to be limited in terms of rapidity for a prescribed level of energy consumption. Microsatellites are therefore typically not as agile as they could be. This conservatism is due to the complexity of implementing global numerical optimisation techniques to satellite attitude control. In this paper, we consider the model of a low earth orbiting microsatellite with a four wheel configuration, where the speed of one of the wheels is kept constant to provide a momentum bias and guarantee gyroscopic stiffness to disturbances. A geometric optimal control approach is presented, which circumvents the tedious tasks of numerically solving online the nonlinear optimisation problem. The approach is based on the design of suboptimal phase space trajectories. The phase space trajectory of a standard linear controller, typically a \\{PD\\} law with gyro-compensation, is used as a benchmark. The proposed inverse optimal control technique is then used to enforce higher convergence rate constraints than the benchmark law, without increasing the total energy consumption. The convergence rate of a Lyapunov function under the effect of the optimal controller outperforms the convergence rate of the same function under \\{PD\\} control and keeps increasing until a design settling time limit is reached. Guidelines are given for the tuning of the controller. The optimal attitude control algorithms are validated on a microsatellite software simulator in collaboration with the space company Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL). The software simulator incorporates a precise model of the effects of estimation errors, noise, external disturbances, sampling and actuator dynamics. The software is similar to the flight software of typical Surrey microsatellites. The proposed techniques are characterised by low implementation complexity because the difficulty is confined to the theoretical design stage. Settling time is significantly enhanced for the same level of energy consumed as the \\{PD\\} type law, which was used as a benchmark without loss of generality.

However, it is still unclear what precisely constitutes agile ISD. Objective Based on four empirical studies conducted over a 10-year time period from 1999 to 2008 the objective of this paper is to show how the meaning and practice of agile \\{ISD\\} has evolved over time and on this basis to speculate about what comes next. Method Four phases of research has been conducted, using a grounded theory approach. For each research phase qualitative interviews were held in American and/or Danish companies and a grounded theory was inductively discovered by careful data analysis. Subsequently, the four unique theories have been analyzed for common themes, and a global theory was identified across the empirical data. Results In 1999 companies were developing software at high-speed in a desperate rush to be first-to-market. In 2001 a new high-speed/quick results development process had become established practice. In 2003 changes in the market created the need for a more balanced view on speed and quality, and in 2008 companies were successfully combining agile and plan-driven approaches to achieve the benefits of both. The studies reveal a two-stage pattern in which dramatic changes in the market causes disruption of established practices and process adaptations followed by consolidation of lessons learnt into a once again stable software development process. Conclusion The cyclical history of punctuated process evolution makes it possible to distinguish pre-agility from current practices (agility), and on this basis, to speculate about post-agility: a possible next cycle of software process evolution concerned with proactively pursuing the dual goal of agility and alignment through a diversity of means.

Objective This paper provides an in-depth discussion of the applicability and implications of open innovation in an agile environment. Method We draw on two illustrative cases from industry. Results We highlight some distinct problems that arose when two project teams tried to combine agile and open innovation principles. For example, openness is often compromised by a perceived competitive element and lack of transparency between business units. In addition, minimal documentation often reduce effective knowledge transfer while the use of short iterations, stand-up meetings and presence of on-site customer reduce the amount of time for sharing ideas outside the team.

For an enterprise to achieve agility, it is critical to create an effective integrated procedure within the business that coordinates and ensures that the agility providers can satisfy the agility capabilities and cope with drivers, ultimately transforming all of these attributes into strategic competitive edges. However, the existing literature on enterprise agility has failed to sufficiently address the relevant perspectives in such analyzes.

Such objectives are achieved with a continuous share of the programmers' daily working life that inevitably influences the programmers' job satisfaction. One of the major challenges in process management is to determine the causes of this satisfaction. Traditional research models job satisfaction with social aspects of collaborative work like communication, work sustainability, and work environment. This study reflects on existing models of job satisfaction in collaborative environments, creates one for modern software development processes, and validates it with a retrospective comparative survey run on a sample of 108 respondents. In addition, the work investigates the impact on job satisfaction and its model of the agile practice of Pair Programming that pushes job sharing to the extreme. With this intent, the questionnaire also collected feedback from pair programmers whose responses were used for a comparative analysis. The results demonstrate that Pair Programming has actually a strong positive effect on satisfaction, work sustainability, and communication.

Method We develop an optimization model that generates a release plan taking into account story size, business value, possible precedence relations, themes, and uncertainty in velocity prediction. The running-time feasibility is established through computational tests. In addition, we provide a practical heuristic approach to velocity estimation. Results Computational tests show that problems with up to six themes and 50 stories can be solved exactly.

Enterprises are typically comprised of hundreds of applications that are custom built at different times, acquired from third parties and parts of legacy systems, and also operating in multiple tiers of different manufacturing and information system platforms. Further, traceability is characterized by a goal-oriented approach, in which business-process analyses are driven by goal achievements rather than by systematic engineering processes. The use of a classical enterprise integration approach mostly needs tailoring to different applications. Due to the number and diversity of the systems and of their interactions, and to their dynamicity, it is difficult, costly, and therefore often not convenient to develop in large scale distributed systems. To overcome these issues, a supply chain traceability system with a high level of automation is discussed in this paper. In particular, the system adopts an agent-based approach, in which cooperative software agents find solutions to back-end tracing problems by self-organization. Such cooperative agents are based on a business process aware traceability model, and on a service-oriented composition paradigm. Furthermore, an interface agent assists each user to carry out the front-end tracking activities. Interface agents rely on the context-awareness paradigm to gain self-configurability and self-adaptation of the user interface, and on ubiquitous computing technology, i.e., mobile devices and radio-frequency identification, to perform agile and automatic lot identification. The paper comprises real-world experiences on the fashion supply chain.

However, given the stochastic nature of the faults, plant equipments and machines usually fail unexpectedly, before the scheduled maintenance action. Therefore, condition based maintenance (CBM) has been introduced, without any fixed interval length between the maintenance actions, as a more efficient maintenance policy. A technique developed for condition based maintenance of electro-mechanical systems is electrical signature analysis. The basic idea behind electrical signature analysis is that, time-dependent load and speed variations in an electro-mechanical system generally induce correlated small variations in the system's electrical response. Electrical signature analysis analyzes these small variations providing diagnostic information. A tool based on this technique is agile in its adoption since no specific sensors must be installed on the machine, but only power signal must be measured and thus the implementation of such tool can be considered simple and flexible. This paper presents a tool that has such kind of characteristics. The tool processes power signals acquired by transducers installed on the electrical lines of electro-mechanical systems, for machine fault diagnosis. The data acquired are processed through some steps, using some signal indicators developed to understand the machine behaviour.
