Title = {{What's Your Strategy for Supply Chain Disclosure?}},
Journal = {{MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW}},

Abstract = {{While global supply chains are expected to be lean, agile, and
   sustainable, they have also become the focus of growing attention from a
   variety of external stakeholders seeking information that includes and
   frequently exceeds what the company is legally obliged to disclose. In
   this article, the authors discuss the pressures on companies to disclose
   supply chain information, the drivers and impediments to such
   disclosure, and the types of supply chain information typically made
   available to the public. The article identifies the broad disclosure
   strategies companies can use to release supply chain information and
   offers managers guidance on designing the optimal disclosure strategy
   for their company. In addition to exploring the topic with examples from
   companies including Nike Inc., WD-40, and Patagonia Inc., the authors
   take a detailed look at how Apple's approach to supply chain disclosure
   has evolved since 2009.
   In considering how to manage supply chain information disclosure, the
   authors argue that managers must appreciate the diverse forces and
   actors driving and enabling this trend. Aside from internal governance
   and risk concerns, external pressure has come from government
   regulations, best practices of peers, changing expectations from salient
   stakeholder groups, and, of course, external events (such as the 2013
   Rana Plaza garment factory collapse in Bangladesh).
   The authors note that improving transparency can be expensive. The lack
   of standardized reporting systems, the absence of a common technology
   platform, ill-defined standards, and a lack of supplier education can
   also pose serious hindrances to companies wishing to improve their
   supply chain transparency.
   The authors identify four common types of supply chain information that
   tends to be publicly disclosed: supply chain membership, provenance of
   materials, environmental information, and information on social impacts
   such as working conditions. Based on their research, they developed a
   transparency matrix to frame four typical supply chain disclosure
   strategies: transparent, secret, distracting, and withheld. The authors
   say managers must understand the demands and respond in creative and
   meaningful ways without undermining the competitive advantage of their
   company. The tools and advice presented in the article can help managers
   navigate this complex and evolving area.}},

Abstract = {{In an increasingly digital and connected environment, leaders of
   established companies frequently find themselves facing opportunities
   that they or even their industries cannot seize alone. Instead of
   relying on start-ups to create innovations and then buying in to them,
   organizations are taking part in a process that the authors call
   ecosystem innovation, collaborating to develop and then commercialize
   new concepts.
   Cisco Hyperinnovation Living Labs (CHILL) differs from seemingly similar
   approaches, such as R\&D alliances, because it focuses on the fast and
   agile commercialization of ideas without a complicated intellectual
   property agreement. It also differs from traditional partnership
   efforts, because it brings multiple partners together at a very early
   stage all at once.
   In this article the authors discuss how large companies can develop
   their own ecosystem innovation capabilities, using Cisco's process as an
   example. They describe the basic principles and the process, identify
   the most common traps, and explain how leaders can capture valuable
   opportunities. The process allows companies to bring extremely diverse
   ideas, skills, and resources together to solve ecosystem-level problems
   at an astonishing speed.}},

Title = {{Reducing age stereotypes in software development: The effects of
   awareness- and cooperation-based diversity interventions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Negative age stereotypes about older employees are present across
   industries and they are particularly strong in technology-related jobs.
   They can hinder cooperation and team processes, which are of utmost
   importance in software development. This paper proposes and compares two
   interventions to reduce age stereotypes in software development. An
   awareness-based intervention was conducted on-the job, as a
   quasi-experiment with 56 participants. A cooperation-based workshop was
   conducted as a field experiment with 74 employees. Both types of
   interventions reduced bias in performance and innovation expectations
   favoring middle-aged over older employees. The reduction in biases held
   by developers was particularly strong. Only the cooperation-based
   intervention reduced bias toward both older and younger employees. This
   intervention led to a long-term (six months) reduction in bias,
   regarding developer performance expectations. The study extends the
   diversity training literature in establishing causal, long-term effects
   for age stereotype reduction in the field. Furthermore, it contributes
   to the literature by indicating that contact hypothesis can not only be
   applied to reduce age stereotypes toward older but also toward younger
   employees. The design enables practitioners to create on-the-job
   diversity interventions that employees are willing to attend, and, thus,
   to reach a majority of employees without interventions being mandatory.

Title = {{Challenges and best practices in industry-academia collaborations in
   software engineering: A systematic literature review}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{106-127}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context: The global software industry and the software engineering (SE)
   academia are two large communities. However, unfortunately, the level of
   joint industry-academia collaborations in SE is still relatively very
   low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities.
   It seems that the two `camps' show only limited interest/motivation to
   collaborate with one other. Many researchers and practitioners have
   written about the challenges, success patterns (what to do, i.e., how to
   collaborate) and anti-patterns (what not do do) for industry-academia
   collaborations.
   Objective: To identify (a) the challenges to avoid risks to the
   collaboration by being aware of the challenges, (b) the best practices
   to provide an inventory of practices (patterns) allowing for an informed
   choice of practices to use when planning and conducting collaborative
   projects.
   Method: A systematic review has been conducted. Synthesis has been done
   using grounded-theory based coding procedures.
   Results: Through thematic analysis we identified 10 challenge themes and
   17 best practice themes. A key outcome was the inventory of best
   practices, the most common ones recommended in different contexts were
   to hold regular workshops and seminars with industry, assure continuous
   learning from industry and academic sides, ensure management engagement,
   the need for a champion, basing research on real world problems, showing
   explicit benefits to the industry partner, be agile during the
   collaboration, and the co-location of the researcher on the industry
   side.
   Conclusion: Given the importance of industry-academia collaboration to
   conduct research of high practical relevance we provide a synthesis of
   challenges and best practices, which can be used by researchers and
   practitioners to make informed decisions on how to structure their
   collaborations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Global software development (GSD) is gaining ever more relevance.
   Although communication is key in the exchange of information between
   team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional
   obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, IT infrastructure, etc.)
   and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic.
   Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software
   Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This
   paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting
   communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the
   perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD.
   The research question to which this study responds concerns how
   development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while
   developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies
   have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media
   tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were
   obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members,
   communication of the status of the development process, and
   communication of the status of the progress of the product under
   development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive
   advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that
   teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient
   video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository
   tools, with information from the process development and product
   characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share
   information about the status of the project/process/product during the
   development process in order to overcome some of the still existing
   problems in communication in AGSD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The oversubscription of Data Center network links and the high
   volatility of Virtual Machine (VM) deployments call for a flexible and
   agile control of Data Center networks, coordinated with computing
   resource control (i.e., cloud resource management). The Software-Defined
   Network (SDN) paradigm opens up new opportunities to design convergent
   resource management systems able to address the provisioning of cloud
   services while meeting dynamically changing traffic demands of running
   VMs.
   This paper presents the architectural design of an SDN-based
   orchestration system which is able to coordinate the provision of
   composite cloud and network services while assuring computational
   requirements as well as a better than best effort VM data delivery. The
   proposed orchestration system is able to perform VM allocations also
   based on estimations of switch/link and server loads as result of the
   synergistic interwork of the following functions: (i) resource selection
   and composition functions, (ii) coordinated resource configuration and
   management functions, (iii) monitoring and registration functions of
   resource status. A set of resource selection and composition strategies
   and estimation schemes have been also specified.
   The orchestration process has been thoroughly evaluated through a
   comprehensive set of simulations that clearly show an increasing
   acceptance rate of service requests, an improved utilization of network
   capabilities while effectively preventing significant degradations of
   the user experience despite the oversubscription of data center network
   links. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a rapidly frequency-tunable radio frequency (RF) filter
   using microwave photonics technology for ultrawideband RF spread
   spectrum applications. A pair of electro-optic frequency combs is
   arranged as a dispersive tapped delay line in a differential detection
   configuration to implement a programmable finite impulse response RF
   filter. Our photonic scheme enables both fast frequency tuning on the
   order of tens of nanoseconds and wide tuning range (>7.5 GHz) with
   minimal variation of RF gain and passband shape. The low control voltage
   (ca. 1 V) and the linear relationship between control voltage and
   passband frequency facilitate agile frequency tuning for processing of
   signals with time-varying frequency content, while differential
   detection increases the photocurrent by a factor of two and suppresses
   common mode intensity noise. We exploit the rapid tunability of the
   implemented filter to demonstrate dynamic tracking of frequency-hopped
   and chirped RF signals. An experiment that performs dynamic filtering of
   an input chirp signal (3.92-GHz center frequency, up-chirped by >2 GHz
   within 100 ns) obscured by strong broadband noise achieves similar to
   11-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement. The SNR obtained is in
   addition to that available from standard matched filtering or pulse
   compression processing, suggesting strong potential for enhanced
   resistance against broadband noise jamming.}},

Abstract = {{Businesses continue to make large investments in information technology

Volume = {{91-92}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The ever increasing requirements of new Internet applications are
   pushing to optimize the design of optical networks. A key design
   criterion in network design is the ability to recover from failures in
   an agile and efficient manner. Protection capabilities are highly
   required in optical networks since the failure of an optical link might
   potentially lead to a significant traffic loss. Under this context,
   Network Coding Protection (NCP) has emerged as an innovative solution to
   proactively enable protection in an agile and efficient manner by means
   of throughput improvement techniques such as Network Coding (NC).
   Nevertheless, the benefits of NC can be reduced by the negative effects
   of inaccurate Network State Information (NSI), which are common in
   dynamic scenarios.
   In this paper, we propose a novel proactive protection strategy based on
   NC jointly with a Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture called
   Predictive Network Coding Protection (PNCP). PNCP leverages predictive
   techniques in order to mitigate the negative impact of the inaccurate
   NSI on the blocking probability. In addition, PNCP computes resilient
   lightpaths with a low amount of network resources devoted for path
   protection.
   By means of extensive simulation results we show that in comparison with
   proactive protection strategies such as Dedicated Path Protection (DPP),
   and conventional dynamic NCP, PNCP reduces the blocking probability as
   well as the network resources allocated for path protection in dynamic
   scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Context: A large waste of resources in software development projects
   currently results from being unable to produce client benefits.
   Objective: The main objective is to better understand the
   characteristics of successful software projects and contribute to
   software projects that are more likely to produce the planned client
   benefits.
   Method: We asked 63 Norwegian software professionals, representing both
   the client and the provider role, to report information about their last
   completed project. In a follow-up survey with 64 Norwegian software
   professionals, we addressed selected findings from the first survey.
   Results: The analysis of the project information showed the following:
   i) The project management triangle criteria of being on time, on budget,
   and having the specified functionality are poor correlates of the
   essential success dimension client benefits. ii) Benefit management
   planning before the project started and benefit management activities
   during project execution were connected with success in delivering
   client benefits. iii) Fixed-price projects and projects in which the
   selection of providers had a strong focus on low price were less
   successful in delivering project benefits than other projects. iv) Agile
   projects were in general more successful than other projects, but agile
   projects without flexible scope to reflect changed user needs and
   learning, or without frequent delivery to the client, had less than
   average success in delivering client benefits.
   Conclusions: The software projects that were successful in delivering
   client benefits differed from the less successful ones in several ways.
   In particular, they applied benefit management practices during project
   execution, they avoided fixed-price contracts, they had less focus on
   low price in the selection of providers, and they applied the core agile
   practices - frequent delivery to the client and scope flexibility. (C)

Abstract = {{Agile development methodologies have been widely employed in the
   software industry, where they have been found to yield positive results.
   But can these new methods, with their new tools such as sprints, scrums,
   burndown charts, and backlogs, really be integrated with the traditional
   and popular Stage-Gate approach and then applied to physical products?
   Initial but limited evidence suggests yes: Larger IT firms have already
   integrated Agile and Stage-Gate and gained the benefits of both
   approaches; and most recently, a handful of manufacturing firms have
   employed this Agile-Stage-Gate hybrid model for physical new products.
   And if recent evidence can be trusted, this new approach promises to be
   the most significant change to our thinking about how new-product
   development should be done since the introduction of today's popular
   gating systems 30 years ago. The benefits of this hybrid model are a
   faster and more adaptive response to changing customer needs, better

Abstract = {{Network function virtualization (NFV) decouples software implementations
   of network functions from their hosts (or hardware). NFV exposes a new
   set of entities, the virtualized network functions (VNFs). The VNFs can
   be chained with other VNFs and physical network functions to realize
   network services. This flexibility introduced by NFV allows service
   providers to respond in an agile manner to variable service demands and
   changing business goals. In this context, the efficient establishment of
   service chains and their placement becomes essential to reduce capital
   and operational expenses and gain in service agility. This paper
   addresses the placement aspect of these service chains by finding the
   best locations and hosts for the VNFs and to steer traffic across these
   functions while respecting user requirements and maximizing provider
   revenue. We propose a novel eigendecomposition-based approach for the
   placement of virtual and physical network function chains in networks
   and cloud environments. A heuristic based on a custom greedy algorithm
   is also presented to compare performance and assess the capability of
   the eigendecomposition approach. The performance of both algorithms is
   compared to a multi-stage-based method from the state of the art that
   also addresses the chaining of network services. Performance evaluation
   results show that our matrix-based method, eigendecomposition of
   adjacency matrices, has reduced complexity and convergence times that
   essentially depend only on the physical graph sizes. Our proposal also
   outperforms the related work in provider's revenue and acceptance rate.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing enables the on-demand delivery of resources for a
   multitude of services and gives the opportunity for small agile
   companies to compete with large industries. In the telco world, cloud
   computing is currently mostly used by mobile network operators (MNO) for
   hosting non-critical support services and selling cloud services such as
   applications and data storage. MNOs are investigating the use of cloud
   computing to deliver key telecommunication services in the access and
   core networks. Without this, MNOs lose the opportunities of both
   combining this with over-the-top (OTT) and value-added services to their
   fundamental service offerings and leveraging cost-effective commodity
   hardware. Being able to leverage cloud computing technology effectively
   for the telco world is the focus of mobile cloud networking (MCN). This
   paper presents the key results of MCN integrated project that includes
   its architecture advancements, prototype implementation, and evaluation.
   Results show the efficiency and the simplicity that a MNO can deploy and
   manage the complete service lifecycle of fully cloudified, composed
   services that combine OTT/IT-and mobile-network-based services running
   on commodity hardware. The extensive performance evaluation of MCN using
   two key proof-of-concept scenarios that compose together many services
   to deliver novel converged elastic, on-demand mobile-based but
   innovative OTT services proves the feasibility of such fully virtualized

Abstract = {{Power budgeting is an essential aspect of networks-on-chip (NoC) to meet
   the power constraint for on-chip communications while assuring the best
   possible overall system performance. For simplicity and ease of
   implementation, existing NoC power budgeting schemes treat all the
   individual routers uniformly when allocating power to them. However,
   such homogeneous power budgeting schemes ignore the fact that the
   workloads of different NoC routers may vary significantly, and thus may
   provide excess power to routers with low workloads, whereas insufficient
   power to those with high workloads. In this paper, we formulate the NoC
   power budgeting problem in order to optimize the network performance
   over a power budget through per-router frequency scaling. We take into
   account of heterogeneous workloads across different routers as imposed
   by variations in traffic. Correspondingly, we propose a fine-grained
   solution using an agile algorithm with low time complexity. Frequency of
   each router is set individually according to its contribution to the
   average network latency while meeting the power budget. Experimental
   results have confirmed that with fairly low runtime and hardware
   overhead, the proposed scheme can help save up to 50 percent application
   execution time when compared with the latest proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper looks at how product development teams balance stability and
   flexibility. It relies on the analysis of an original, qualitative study
   of agile software development teams, which operate in an environment
   characterized by the simultaneous implementation of interdependent
   organizational routines. We argue that the interdependencies among
   routines are seized by organizational members who manipulate the level
   of `protection' that each routine is granted (i.e. the enforcement of
   adherence to the routine). Less protection permits flexibility, whereas
   more protection creates stability. We observe that `protection' can be
   exerted along two different, yet related, dimensions: content of the
   routine and performance of the routine. The interplay of these two
   dimensions generates a space within which organizational members can
   vary the level of the routines' protection (regarding their content, or
   their performance, or both) in order to influence the stability and
   flexibility of work processes and outcomes. We explain how controlling
   the interplay of different routines via choices regarding their
   protection enables teams to balance stability and flexibility. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Multicarrier waveforms bring several major advantages over single
   carrier waveforms in radar systems: frequency diversity, waveform
   diversity, short time on target and the possibility to optimize the
   transmitted waveforms, to mention a few. Interesting waveform designs
   utilizing diversity have been proposed in the literature already. In
   this paper, we develop a generalized model that can accommodate a wide
   variety of design options, both existing and novel ones, in an easy and
   intuitive way. The developed matrix equations for transmitter and
   receiver allow for implementing different waveforms simply by filling in
   the elements to corresponding matrices accordingly. Moreover, intuitive
   agile generation of waveforms in simulation environments and in practice
   is facilitated. Waveform optimization examples are provided using the
   derived model. A Mutual Information based criterion is employed to
   formulate the optimization problems which are solved analytically. Novel
   multicarrier spread spectrum waveforms are proposed and generated using
   the derived model. The radar performance of one of these waveforms is
   investigated through simulations. It is demonstrated that it can
   outperform well-known existing multicarrier waveforms. It is also shown
   that such waveform can lower the peak-to-average-power ratio due to the
   spreading operation, which is a benefit for the front end designs of the
   transmitter and receiver.}},

Abstract = {{Agile methods have become an appealing alternative for companies

   review on how agile methods and lean software development has been
   adopted at scale, focusing on reported challenges and success factors in
   the transformation. We conducted a systematic literature review of
   industrial large-scale agile transformations. Our keyword search found
   1875 papers. We included 52 publications describing 42 industrial cases
   presenting the process of taking large-scale agile development into use.
   Almost 90\% of the included papers were experience reports, indicating a

Abstract = {{The growing interest in Agile and Lean software development is reflected

   quality, schedule, budget, resources, communication, and risk. In this
   tertiary study, 13 secondary studies were included for detailed
   analysis. Given the heterogeneity of the data, we were unable to perform
   a rigorous synthesis. Instead, we mapped the identified Agile and Lean

   PMBOK. From 13 secondary studies, we identified 13 Agile and Lean
   practices. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is studied in ten secondary
   studies, meanwhile other practices are studied in only one or two
   secondary studies. This tertiary study provides a consolidated view of
   the impacts of Agile and Lean practices. The result of this tertiary
   study indicates that TDD has a positive impact on external quality.

Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{61-79}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context: It is an enigma that agile projects can succeed `without
   requirements' when weak requirements engineering is a known cause for
   project failures. While agile development projects often manage well
   without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as
   requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases.
   Objective: We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases
   as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main
   requirements activities, and how this practice varies.
   Method: We performed an iterative case study at three companies and
   collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups.
   Results: The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and
   challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing
   requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have
   identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice,
   namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict
   and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies
   concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the
   requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine
   executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific
   support for the practice of using test cases as requirements.
   Conclusions: The findings provide empirical insight into how agile
   development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified
   variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used
   to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering.
   Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in
   designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on
   project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of
   change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   concerns}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{92-104}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context: There continues to be concern that research is not addressing
   the challenges that practice faces. For the benefit of academia and
   industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and
   their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken.
   Objective: This paper investigates two research questions: what
   challenges do agile, practitioners face? and, how do practitioner
   challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to
   map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge
   characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify
   implications for research that is relevant to practice.
   Method: A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner
   challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner
   events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis
   and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to
   previous publications.
   Results: Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under
   27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation,
   sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one
   challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which
   were inter-related. Over 50\% of survey respondents experienced
   challenges highlighted in the case study.
   Conclusion: The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex
   and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile
   environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and
   may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social
   and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural
   change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while
   others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such
   as governance and contracts, are under-researched, While others, such as
   business and IT transformation, have been researched but findings{''}
   have not had the expected impact. Researchers wishing to address
   practitioner challenges need to treat them in context rather than in
   isolation and improve knowledge transfer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The RF design of stub-loaded-based wide-band bandpass filters (BPFs)
   with multiple tunable rejection bands in their transmission range is
   presented. The proposed concept exploits the replacement of the
   short-circuited resonant stubs of the stub-loaded-based BPF with
   multi-band bandstop (BS) sections. Each multi-frequency BS section is
   formed by several in-parallel-cascaded 90 degrees-long stubs that are
   terminated by frequency-agile resonators so that each of them results in
   an independently-controlled transmission zero. In this manner, a
   plurality of high-order reflective-type rejection bands can be created
   and arbitrarily controlled. Further operational characteristics include:
   (i) scalability to any number of rejection bands and degree of
   selectivity, (ii) independent tuning of each notch without any influence
   on the remaining ones, and (iii) spectral-merging of multiple stopbands
   to increase their bandwidth (BW) and enable controllability of the
   number of active notches in the passband. The aforementioned principles
   are experimentally validated through a prototype that exhibits a wide
   band (fractional BW: 68\%), low-loss (<0.7 dB) passband at 1000 MHz and
   two high-attenuation (>60 dB) notches that can be independently tuned
   within the 870-1150 MHz range.}},

Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{A compact planar ultrawideband antenna with continuously tunable,
   independent band notches for cognitive radio applications is presented.
   The antenna is fabricated using a copper-cladded substrate. A radiating
   patch with an inverted rectangular T-slot is etched on the top side of
   the substrate. A straight rectangular strip with a complete gap is
   embedded into the T-slot. By placing a single varactor diode across this
   gap, a frequency-agile band-notch function below 5 GHz is realized. On
   the bottom side of the substrate, a U-shaped parasitic element having an
   interdigitated-structure is placed beneath the radiating patch. The
   second narrow band notch is created by inserting a second varactor diode
   into the gap on one leg of the parasitic element. It has a
   frequency-agile performance above 5 GHz. The presence of the
   interdigitated structure suppresses higher order resonant modes and
   enhances the tunability of the notched bandwidth. Because these antenna
   structures naturally block dc, a very small number of lumped elements
   are required. The experimental results, which are in good agreement with
   their simulated values, demonstrate that both band notches can be
   independently controlled and the entire frequency-agile fractional
   bandwidth is as high as 74.5\%, demonstrating a very wide notched
   frequency-agile coverage.}},

Pages = {{469-489}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In the beginning of the e-commerce era, retailers mostly adopted
   vertically integrated solutions to control the entire e-commerce value
   chain. However, they began to realize that to achieve agility, a better
   approach would be to focus on certain core capabilities and then create
   a partner ecosystem around them. From a technical point of view, this
   means it is advised to have a lightweight platform architecture with
   small core e-commerce functionality which can be extended by additional
   services from third party providers. In a typical e-commerce ecosystem
   with diverse information systems of network partners, integration and
   interoperability become critical factors to enable seamless coordination
   among the partners. Furthermore an increasing adoption of cloud
   computing technology could be observed resulting in more challenging
   integration scenarios involving cloud services. Thus, an e-commerce
   platform is required that suites the advanced needs for flexible and
   agile service integration. Therefore, this paper aims to present a
   reference architecture of a novel pluggable service platform for
   e-commerce. We investigate on currently available online shop platform
   solutions and integration platforms in the market. Based on the findings
   and motivated by literature on service-oriented design, we develop an
   architecture of a service-based pluggable platform for online retailers.
   This design is then instantiated by means of a prototype for an
   e-commerce returns handling scenario to demonstrate the feasibility of
   our architecture design.}},

Abstract = {{HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is widely deployed on the Internet for
   live and on-demand video streaming services. Video adaptation algorithms
   in the existing HAS systems are either too sluggish to respond to
   congestion level shifts or too sensitive to short-term network bandwidth
   variations. Both degrade user video experience. In this paper, we
   formally study the tradeoff between responsiveness and smoothness in HAS
   through analysis and experiments. We show that client-side buffered
   video time is a good feedback signal to guide video adaptation. We then
   propose novel video rate control algorithms that balance the needs for
   video rate smoothness and high bandwidth utilization. We show that a
   small video rate margin can lead to much improved smoothness in video
   rate and buffer size. We also propose HAS designs that can work with
   multiple servers and wireless connections. We develop a fully functional
   HAS system and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments on
   a network testbed and the Internet. We demonstrate that our HAS designs
   are highly efficient and robust in realistic network environment.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, considerable attention is paid to agile methods as a means to
   improve management of software development processes. The widespread use
   of such methods in professional contexts has encouraged their
   integration into software engineering training and undergraduate
   courses. Although several research efforts have focused on teaching
   Scrum through simulating a software development project, they covered
   only the learning of programming practices within a Scrum team.
   Furthermore, few studies tackle nontechnical skills other than the
   development practices themselves. The work presented here introduces an
   original Scrum-based training model enhanced with agile coaching to
   maximize student performance. This was validated by a case study on a
   capstone project in a Scrum course. This paper summarizes the positive
   results of introducing agile coaching, which resulted in approximately
   22\% more coverage of software engineering practices. In addition, a
   survey data showed that, compared to students who did not receive
   coaching, coached students gained valuable insight into the

Abstract = {{Flying insects and swimming fishes have high efficiency and high
   maneuverability in air and water, respectively. Their wings and fins
   have evolved for many ages to adapt to propelling in the complex
   environment. In this paper, an integrative biomimetic robotic fish is
   proposed and developed, which combines the advantages of insect wings
   and fish fins to achieve a high agility underwater. In the robotic fish,
   two caudal fins were equipped at the tail of the robotic fish in
   parallel as the main propulsion mechanism, the opposite flapping of the
   two caudal fins generates mutually opposing lateral forces during
   cruising, which leads to a stable and high-performance swimming. In
   addition, two pectoral fins that mimic the function of insect wings were
   equipped at two sides of the robotic fish, which enhances the robotic
   fish maneuverability in vertical plane. Moreover, a central pattern
   generator model was designed to achieve the versatile maneuvering
   motions, motion switching, and autonomous swimming with an obstacle
   avoiding ability. The experiments have demonstrated that the robotic
   fish can swim more stably and efficiently with versatile maneuver
   motions by taking advantage of the integrative propulsion mechanism. The
   developed robotic fish have many potential applications for its agility,

Abstract = {{Agile methods are widely utilized in software development but their

   Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were

   Objective: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize research about the most

   development life cycle for ubiquitous systems.
   Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting
   and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software
   development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were
   classified according to the phase of the development cycle they
   addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations.
   Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing

   implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others
   phases such as testing need more attention from researchers.
   Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting

Abstract = {{Network virtualization promises to fulfill the demand for an agile

   tremendous efforts have been dedicated to studying the fundamental
   problem in network virtualization, namely Virtual Network Embedding

   security issues and implications of VNE or network virtualization as a
   whole, despite their importance. On one hand, the literature lacks a
   systematic overview of security issues in network virtualization (e.g.,
   which can be VNE-relevant or VNE-irrelevant). On the other hand,
   existing studies on security-aware VNE share common limitations. This
   paper aims to present a timely study to fill the above needs with the

   In addition, network resources such as bandwidth and spectrum can also

Abstract = {{The enormous transmitter power, fully programmable antenna array, and
   agile frequency generation of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research
   Program (HAARP) facility in Alaska have allowed the production of
   unprecedented disturbances in the ionosphere. Using both pencil beams
   and conical (or twisted) beam transmissions, artificial ionization
   clouds have been generated near the second, third, fourth, and sixth
   harmonics of the electron gyrofrequency. The conical beam has been used
   to sustain these clouds for up to 5h as opposed to less than 30min
   durations produced using pencil beams. The largest density plasma clouds
   have been produced at the highest harmonic transmissions. Satellite
   radio transmissions at 253MHz from the National Research Laboratory
   TACSat4 communications experiment have been severely disturbed by
   propagating through artificial plasma regions. The scintillation levels
   for UHF waves passing through artificial ionization clouds from HAARP
   are typically 16dB. This is much larger than previously reported
   scintillations at other HF facilities which have been limited to 3dB or
   less. The goals of future HAARP experiments should be to build on these
   discoveries to sustain plasma densities larger than that of the
   background ionosphere for use as ionospheric reflectors of radio
   signals.}},

Abstract = {{The best management of a disaster requires knowledge, skills and other
   resources not only for relief and rehabilitation but also for recovery
   and mitigation of its effects. These multifaceted goals cannot be
   achieved by a single organization and require collaborative efforts in
   an agile manner. Blind trust cannot be applied while selecting
   collaborators/team members/partners therefore good reputation of a
   collaborator is mandatory. Currently, various Information and
   Communication Technology based artifacts, for collaborative disaster
   management, have been developed; however, they do not employ trust and
   reputation as their key factor. In this paper, a framework of reputation
   based trust management system is proposed for the support of disaster
   management. The key features of framework are Meta model, Reputation
   Indicator Matrix and Computational algorithm, deployed using Service
   Oriented Architecture. To evaluate the efficacy of the artifact, a
   prototype is implemented. Furthermore, an industrial survey is carried
   out to get the feedback on the proposed framework. The results support
   that the proposed reputation management system provides significant
   support in collaborative disaster management by assisting in agile and
   smart decision making in all phases of disaster management cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Agile software development continues to grow in popularity and

   development programmes}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Context: Large-scale offshore software development programmes are
   complex, with challenging deadlines and a high risk of failure. Agile
   methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating
   multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team
   coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software
   development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of
   teams on the same development programme.
   Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development
   processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore
   software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories
   used in the development process.
   Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews,
   supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine
   international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of
   open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in
   data analysis.
   Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five
   categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance.
   It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with
   artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide
   governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used
   to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to
   specific activities within each of the agile roles.
   Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and
   plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality
   standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of
   failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently
   improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding

Abstract = {{The beamforming techniques have been recently studied as possible
   enablers for underlay spectrum sharing. The existing beamforming
   techniques have several common limitations: they are usually system
   model specific, cannot operate with arbitrary number of transmit/receive
   antennas, and cannot serve arbitrary number of users. Moreover, the
   beamforming techniques for underlay spectrum sharing do not consider the
   interference originating from the incumbent primary system. This paper
   extends the common underlay sharing model by incorporating the
   interference originating from the incumbent system into generic combined
   beamforming design that can be applied on interference, broadcast, or
   multiple access channels. This paper proposes two novel multiuser
   beamforming algorithms for user fairness and sum rate maximization,
   utilizing newly derived convex optimization problems for transmit and
   receive beamformers calculation in a recursive optimization. Both
   beamforming algorithms provide efficient operation for the interference,
   broadcast, and multiple access channels, as well as for arbitrary number
   of antennas and secondary users in the system. Furthermore, this paper
   proposes a successive transmit/receive optimization approach that
   reduces the computational complexity of the proposed recursive
   algorithms. The results show that the proposed complexity reduction
   significantly improves the convergence rates and can facilitate their
   operation in scenarios, which require agile beamformer computation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and analysis of orthogonal,
   Doppler-tolerant waveforms for waveform agile radar (e.g. multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) radar) applications. Previous work has given
   little consideration to the design of radar waveforms that remain
   orthogonal when they are received. Our research is focused on: 1)
   developing sets of waveforms that are orthogonal on both transmit and
   receive, and 2) ensuring that these waveforms are Doppler tolerant when
   properly processed. Our proposed solution achieves the above-mentioned
   goals by incorporating direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) coding
   techniques on linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals. We call this
   spread spectrum coded LFM (SSCL) signaling. Our transmitted LFM
   waveforms are rendered orthogonal with a unique spread spectrum (SS)
   code. At the receiver, the echo signal will be decoded using its
   spreading code. In this manner, transmitted orthogonal waveforms can be
   match filtered only with the intended received signals. From analytical
   expressions of the waveforms we have designed and from simulation
   results, we found that: 1) cross-ambiguity function (CAF) of two LFM SS
   coded (orthogonal) waveforms is small for all delays and Dopplers (i.e.
   transmit and receive signals satisfy near orthogonality constraint); 2)
   the length of the SS code determines the amount of interference
   suppression (i.e., complete orthogonal or near orthogonal of the
   received signal); 3) we can process the same received signal in two
   different ways; one method can provide LFM signal resolution and the
   other method can provide ultrahigh resolution; 4) biorthogonal codes can
   be used to reduce bandwidth when code length is large. Our proposed
   waveforms inherit multiple attributes (e.g. chirp diversity, code
   diversity, frequency diversity) of diverse waveforms.}},

Abstract = {{Climbing robots that integrate an articulated arm as their main climbing
   mechanism can eventually take advantage of their arm for plane
   transition and thus to operate on 3D structures rather than only
   climbing planar surfaces. However, they are usually slower than wheel
   based climbing robots. Within this research we address this problem by
   integration of a light-weight arm and adhesion mechanism into an
   omnidirectional wheel based climbing robot, thus forming a hybrid
   mechanism that is agile in climbing and still able to perform plane
   transition. A 2DOF (Degree of Freedom) plannar mechanism with 2 linear
   actuators was designed as a light-weight manipulator for the transition
   mechanism. Furthermore, we customized and developed actuated switchable
   magnets both for the robot chassis and also as the adhesion unit of the
   arm. These units allow us to control the amount of magnetic adhesion
   force, resulting in better adaptation to different surface
   characteristics. The adhesion units are safe for climbing applications
   with a very small power consumption. The conceptual and the detailed
   design of the mechanisms are presented. The robots were developed and
   successfully tested on a ferromagnetic structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Iterative development increasingly seeks to incorporate design

   agreement about the negative effects upon agility of deferring
   refactoring. Nevertheless, the survey found that roles had different
   perspectives on the different kinds of tasks in an agile process.
   Accordingly, there was no universally agreed-upon strategy for how to
   plan to carry out refactoring. Analysis of the survey results has raised
   many interesting questions suggesting the need for a considerable amount

Abstract = {{The amount of data produced and communicated over the Internet is
   significantly increasing, thereby creating challenges for the
   organizations that would like to reap the benefits from analyzing this
   massive influx of big data. This is because big data can provide unique
   insights into, inter alia, market trends, customer buying patterns, and
   maintenance cycles, as well as into ways of lowering costs and enabling
   more targeted business decisions. Realizing the importance of big data
   business analytics (BDBA), we review and classify the literature on the
   application of BDBA on logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) -
   that we define as supply chain analytics (SCA), based on the nature of
   analytics (descriptive, predictive, prescriptive) and the focus of the
   LSCM (strategy and operations). To assess the extent to which SCA is
   applied within LSCM, we propose a maturity framework of SCA, based on
   four capability levels, that is, functional, process-based,
   collaborative, agile SCA, and sustainable SCA. We highlight the role of
   SCA in LSCM and denote the use of methodologies and techniques to
   collect, disseminate, analyze, and use big data driven information.
   Furthermore, we stress the need for managers to understand BDBA and SCA
   as strategic assets that should be integrated across business activities
   to enable integrated enterprise business analytics. Finally, we outline
   the limitations of our study and future research directions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Context: Test Driven Development (TDD) is an agile practice that has
   gained popularity when it was defined as a fundamental part in eXtreme
   Programming (XP).
   Objective: This study analyzed the conclusions of previously published
   articles on the effects of TDD on internal and external software quality
   and productivity, comparing TDD with Test Last Development (TLD).
   Method: In this study, a systematic literature review has been conducted
   considering articles published between 1999 and 2014.
   Results: In about 57\% of the analyzed studies, the results were
   validated through experiments and in 32\% of them, validation was
   performed through a case study. The results of this analysis show that
   76\% of the studies have identified a significant increase in internal
   software quality while 88\% of the studies identified a meaningful
   increase in external software quality. There was an increase in
   productivity in the academic environment, while in the industrial
   scenario there was a decrease in productivity. Overall, about 44\% of
   the studies indicated lower productivity when using TDD compared to TLD.
   Conclusion: According to our findings, TDD yields more benefits than TLD
   for internal and external software quality, but it results in lower
   developer productivity than TLD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The wide-spread adoption of the agile movement has rapidly changed the
   landscape of software industry. In particular, Scrum is an agile process
   framework that has become extremely popular in industry. However, the
   practical implementation of Scrum in companies rarely follows the text
   book ideals, as companies often deviate from the proposed Scrum
   practices for various reasons. While some deviations may be well
   motivated and reasonable, companies can also be tempted to adjust Scrum
   for the company without clearly understanding the consequences of the
   deviations. In this paper our aim is to identify ways of potentially
   harmful mishandling of Scrum in industry based on empirical data
   collected in semi-structured interviews involving 18 teams in 11
   companies. The (mal)practices that were identified at least in three
   different teams are presented in a semi-formal manner as anti-patterns.
   The study resulted in 14 anti-patterns that express the context of the
   deviation, the deviation itself, the broken core principles of Scrum,
   and the possible consequences of the deviation. In addition, where
   available, we have included company recommendations regarding the
   deviations. Furthermore, we identify potential risk areas in Scrum based
   on an analysis of the relationships between anti-patterns and Scrum

Abstract = {{The importance of architectural knowledge (AK) management for software
   development has been highlighted over the past ten years, where a
   significant amount of research has been done. Since the first systems

   models, approaches, and research tools have leveraged the interests of
   researchers and practitioners in AK management (AKM). Capturing,
   sharing, and using AK has many benefits for software designers and
   maintainers, but the cost to capture this relevant knowledge hampers a
   widespread use by software companies. However, as the improvements made
   over the last decade didn't boost a wider adoption of AKM approaches,
   there is a need to identify the successes and shortcomings of current AK
   approaches and know what industry needs from AK. Therefore, as
   researchers and promoters of many of the AK research tools in the early
   stages where AK became relevant for the software architecture community,

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been significant shift from rigid development
   (RD) toward agile. However, it has also been spotted that agile
   methodologies are hardly ever followed in their pure form. Hybrid
   processes as combinations of RD and agile practices emerge. In addition,
   agile adoption has been reported to result in both benefits and
   limitations. This exploratory study (a) identifies development models
   based on RD and agile practice usage by practitioners; (b) identifies
   agile practice adoption scenarios based on eliciting practice usage over
   time; (c) prioritizes agile benefits and limitations in relation to (a)
   and (b). Practitioners provided answers through a questionnaire. The
   development models are determined using hierarchical cluster analysis.
   The use of practices over time is captured through an interactive board
   with practices and time indication sliders. This study uses the extended
   hierarchical voting analysis framework to investigate benefit and
   limitation prioritization. Four types of development models and six
   adoption scenarios have been identified. Overall, 45 practitioners
   participated in the prioritization study. A common benefit among all
   models and adoption patterns is knowledge and learning, while high
   requirements on professional skills were perceived as the main
   limitation. Furthermore, significant variances in terms of benefits and
   limitations have been observed between models and adoption patterns. The
   most significant internal benefit categories from adopting agile are
   knowledge and learning, employee satisfaction, social skill development,
   and feedback and confidence. Professional skill-specific demands,
   scalability, and lack of suitability for specific product domains are
   the main limitations of agile practice usage. Having a balanced agile
   process allows to achieve a high number of benefits. With respect to
   adoption, a big bang transition from RD to agile leads to poor quality
   in comparison with the alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigated an Earth observation scheduling problem for
   agile satellites under a time window constraint and resource constraints
   of limited on-board memory capacity and consecutive working time. We
   assumed that different observation tasks may have priority levels, and
   the objective is to maximize the total priority of selected tasks. To
   address the problem, we first presented a detailed problem description
   and developed a mathematical programming model. Considering the
   over-constrained feature of the problem, we developed constructive
   algorithms to solve the problem, which adopt a priority-based sequential
   construction procedure to avoid conflicts and generate feasible
   solutions. The proposed sequential construction procedure contributes to
   eliminating the need for extra constraint handling techniques, and helps
   to reduce the complexity of feasibility checking. By analyzing the
   competitive relationship of various resources, we proved the condition
   of mutual exclusion of time windows and then developed new
   priority-based indicators to evaluate the benefits and opportunity costs
   of different positioning decisions, which is a key component to be used
   in the proposed constructive algorithms. Through extensive computational
   experiments on various scenarios including real-world data from China's
   satellite platform, the effectiveness of the developed constructive
   algorithms was verified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In frequency agile radar (FAR), successive pulses each with different

   moving trace in the echo plane will be present after conventional pulse
   compression. The distortion will defocus the echo energy in the
   integration process when combining multiple pulses. In addition, for
   high-speed targets, the traditional narrowband matched filter will
   suffer from a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio, especially when pulses
   with large duration or bandwidths are used. A long-time coherent

Abstract = {{We consider the analysis of network traffic data for identifying highly
   agile DNS patterns which are widely considered indicative for
   cybercrime. In contrast to related approaches, our methodology is
   capable of explicitly distinguishing between the individual, inherent
   agility of benign Internet services and criminal sites. Although some
   benign services use a large number of addresses, they are confined to a
   subset of IP addresses, due to operational requirements and contractual
   agreements with certain Content Distribution Networks. We discuss
   DNSMap, a system which analyzes observed DNS traffic, and continuously
   learns which FQDNs are hosted on which IP addresses. Any significant
   changes over time are mapped to bipartite graphs, which are then further
   pruned for cybercrime activity. Graph analysis enables the detection of
   transitive relations between FQDNs and IPs, and reveals clusters of
   malicious FQDNs and IP addresses hosting them. We developed a prototype
   system which is designed for realtime analysis, requires no costly
   classifier retraining, and no excessive whitelisting. We evaluate our
   system using large data sets from an ISP with several 100,000 customers,

Abstract = {{Objective Electronic medical records (EMRs) are being increasingly
   utilized to conduct clinical and epidemiologic research in numerous
   fields. To monitor and improve care of HIV-infected patients in
   Washington, DC, one of the most severely affected urban areas in the
   United States, we developed a city-wide database across 13 clinical
   sites using electronic data abstraction and manual data entry from EMRs.
   Materials and Methods To develop this unique longitudinal cohort, a
   web-based electronic data capture system (Discovere (R)) was used. An
   Agile software development methodology was implemented across multiple
   EMR platforms. Clinical informatics staff worked with information
   technology specialists from each site to abstract data electronically
   from each respective site's EMR through an extract, transform, and load
   process.
   Results Since enrollment began in 2011, more than 7000 patients have
   been enrolled, with longitudinal clinical data available on all
   patients. Data sets are produced for scientific analyses on a quarterly
   basis, and benchmarking reports are generated semi-annually enabling
   each site to compare their participants' clinical status, treatments,
   and outcomes to the aggregated summaries from all other sites.
   Discussion Numerous technical challenges were identified and innovative
   solutions developed to ensure the successful implementation of the DC
   Cohort. Central to the success of this project was the broad
   collaboration established between government, academia, clinics,
   community, information technology staff, and the patients themselves.
   Conclusions Our experiences may have practical implications for
   researchers who seek to merge data from diverse clinical databases, and
   are applicable to the study of health-related issues beyond HIV.}},

Abstract = {{Service Oriented Computing is a relevant paradigm that allows for
   building software solutions as it supports the creation of dynamic and
   agile applications. As a result of these benefits, applications based on
   the paradigm are commonly used in the industry. However, the more
   complex software solutions become, the higher the chance of having bugs
   is. Identifying them in the entire solution may also be one of the most
   tedious, expensive and time-consuming activity within the developing
   process. Therefore, fault localization aims at finding the location of
   faults, determining the root cause of the failure and identifying the
   causes of abnormal behavior of a faulty program. In particular, fault
   localization for service oriented applications is currently a research
   field that has received little attention. In this context, we present a
   taxonomy-based approach for fault localization in service oriented
   applications, using information of faults in the underlying architecture
   of these applications, namely SOA. The results on the location of faults
   are not only provided to the developer but also enhanced with
   architectural information, that is, showing the faults and their
   connection with exceptions, code and architectural scenarios. The
   experimental results carried out indicate that developers reduce their
   effort of localizing faults in terms of time and lines of code.}},

Abstract = {{Fast access to communication networks and the availability of

   challenges. Accordingly, a responsive and high-performance ICT
   infrastructure remains a top priority for firms. Thus, new ICT sourcing
   strategies may lead to significant competitive advantages, especially in

Abstract = {{Supply chain planning as one of the most important processes within the
   supply chain management concept, has a great impact on firms' success or
   failure. This paper considers a supply chain planning problem of an
   agile manufacturing company operating in a build-to-order environment
   under various kinds of uncertainty. An integrated optimization approach
   of procurement, production and distribution costs associated with the
   supply chain members has been taken into account. A robust optimization
   scenario-based approach is used to absorb the influence of uncertain
   parameters and variables. The formulation is a robust optimization model
   with the objective of minimizing the expected total supply chain cost
   while maintaining customer service level. The developed multi-product,
   multiperiod, multi-echelon robust mixed-integer linear programming model
   is then solved using the CPLEX optimization studio and guidance related
   to future areas of research is given.}},

Abstract = {{Software engineering and mission command are two separate but similar
   fields, as both are instances of complex problem solving in environments
   with ever changing requirements. Our research hypothesis is that
   modifications to agile software development based on inspirations from
   mission command can improve the software engineering process in terms of
   planning, prioritizing, and communication of software requirements and
   progress, as well as improving the overall software product. Targeted
   Scrum is a modification of Traditional Scrum based on three inspirations
   from Mission Command: End State, Line of Effort, and Targeting. These
   inspirations have led to the introduction of the Product Design Meeting
   and modifications of some current Scrum meetings and artifacts. We
   tested our research hypothesis using a semester-long undergraduate level
   software engineering class. Students developed two software projects,
   one using Traditional Scrum and the other using Targeted Scrum. We then
   assessed how well both methodologies assisted the software development
   teams in planning and developing the software architecture, prioritizing
   requirements, and communicating progress. We also evaluated the software
   product produced by both methodologies. We found that Targeted Scrum did
   better in assisting the software development teams in the planning and
   prioritization of the requirements. However, Targeted Scrum had a
   negligible effect on improving the software development teams external
   and internal communications. Finally, Targeted Scrum did not have an

Abstract = {{Frequency-agile pathloss models for urban street canyons are discussed
   in this paper. The models are floating intercept (FI), fixed reference
   (FR), and ITU-R M. 2135 urban microcellular (UMi) line-of-sight (LOS)
   and Manhattan-grid non-LOS (NLOS) models. These models are parameterized
   based on channel sounding campaigns in three cities covering radio
   frequencies ranging from 0.8 to 60 GHz. Fitting the models with measured
   pathloss reveals that the models are usable to cover the considered
   frequency range. The FI and FR models are equally simple and robust,
   with a slight advantage of the FI model in accuracy because of the
   larger number of model parameters. The original M. 2135 LOSmodel is
   based on a two-ray model that includes a break point (BP). The model is
   extended for a better fit with measurements by including new model
   parameters such as a pathloss offset and a BP scaling factor that
   represent local scattering conditions of surrounding environments. The
   new model parameters are found frequency dependent in many cases. The
   original M. 2135 model is furthermore simplified in NLOS scenarios while
   maintaining the model accuracy. The model parameters are derived using
   maximum likelihood estimation, which also showed that the modified M.
   2135 model offers up to 50\% better accuracy compared to the FI and FR
   models in terms of the employed log-likelihood function (LLF). The
   improvement in accuracy is particularly remarkable in NLOS scenarios. A
   full set of parameters is provided for the models, allowing a choice for
   any given requirements on accuracy and complexity. Finally,
   applicability of the proposed models to other street canyons is
   discussed using independent pathloss measurements.}},

   agility should be considered a team's performance, rather than a mere
   adjective for practices and methods; ii) agility, as a performance,
   might be dependent upon a combination of organization, team and project

Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{During the last few years, there has been a growing interest around the
   development of new ideas envisioning the opportunities of combining
   Internet and Services. The ``Future Internet{''} (FI) concept has been
   introduced and it is now central to several initiatives. Specifically,
   with respect to the Internet of Services, many research communities
   refer to the well-founded Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) as the
   reference paradigm for FI computing. SOC promotes the idea of assembling
   application services into a network of services that can be loosely
   coupled to create flexible, dynamic business processes and agile
   software systems, which span organizations and computing platforms.
   Service composition approaches will certainly have an important role in
   shaping the SOC within the vision of FI. Despite the great interest in
   Service Composition, no common foundations and principles have been
   established yet for the FI of Services. Developing FI applications
   encompasses a variety of aspects, ranging from modeling and analysis
   issues in the early phases of their development, to issues related to
   their implementation and run-time management. This thematic series
   brings together innovative contributions to the research and development
   of novel service composition approaches to assist the design,

Pages = {{938-947}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a blending principle of tail fins and reaction jets
   to achieve a fast response for a dual-controlled missile under a
   slew-rate limit. The blending principle can be categorized as
   controlling either the net force or the net moment according to how the
   two actuators cooperate with each other. When compared with controlling
   the net moment, controlling the net force of aerodynamic lift and jet
   thrust allows direct control of the acceleration, thus enabling a much
   faster response but at the expense of large control effort. In this
   work, for the initial transient period a force controller is designed to
   achieve fast response under the slew-rate limit, then the transition
   control is proposed, which begins with force control and makes a
   transition to moment control to reduce the control usage. This
   transition does not involve switching from one controller to the other.
   Rather, the angle of attack is properly shaped corresponding to the
   desired moment, allowing a smooth and stable transition from force
   control to moment control. The smooth transition by the proposed
   strategy from force control to moment control is demonstrated with
   nonlinear missile dynamics. The proposed approach shows a very fast
   response, while its input usage is almost same as the conventional
   moment control.}},

Abstract = {{Open innovation (OI) means that innovation is fostered by using both
   external and internal influences in the innovation process. In software
   engineering (SE), OI has existed for decades, while we currently see a
   faster and broader move towards OI in SE. We therefore survey research
   on how OI takes place and contributes to innovation in SE. This study
   aims to synthesize the research knowledge on OI in the SE domain. We
   launched a systematic mapping study and conducted a thematic analysis of
   the results. Moreover, we analyzed the strength of the evidence in the
   light of a rigor and relevance assessment of the research. We identified
   33 publications, divided into 9 themes related to OI. 17/33 studies fall
   in the high-rigor/high-relevance category, suggesting the results are
   highly industry relevant. The research indicates that start-ups have
   higher tendency to opt for OI compared to incumbents. The evidence also
   suggests that firms assimilating knowledge into their internal R\&D
   activities, have higher likelihood of gaining financial advantages. We
   concluded that OI should be adopted as a complementary approach to
   facilitate internal innovation and not to substitute it. Further
   research is advised on situated OI strategies and the interplay between
   OI and agile practices.}},

Abstract = {{The daily stand-up meeting is one of the most used agile practices but

   aims to identify how daily stand-up meetings are conducted and what the

   teams in three companies in Malaysia, Norway, Poland and the United
   Kingdom was conducted. We interviewed 60 people, observed 79 daily
   stand-up meetings and collected supplementary data. The factors that
   contributed the most to a positive attitude towards the daily stand-up
   meeting were information sharing with the team and the opportunity to
   discuss and solve problems. The factors that contributed the most to a
   negative attitude were status reporting to the manager and that the
   frequency of the meeting was perceived to be too high and the duration
   too long. Based on our results, we developed a grounded theory of daily
   standup meetings and proposed empirically based recommendations and

Abstract = {{Secure communication is an important aspect of today's interconnected
   environments and it can be achieved by the use of cryptographic
   algorithms and protocols. However, many existing cryptographic
   mechanisms are tightly integrated into communication protocols. Issues
   emerge when security vulnerabilities are discovered in cryptographic
   mechanisms because their replacement would eventually require replacing
   deployed protocols. The concept of cryptographic agility is the solution
   to these issues because it allows dynamic switching of cryptographic
   algorithms and keys prior to and during the communication. Most of
   today's secure protocols implement cryptographic agility (IPsec,
   SSL/TLS, SSH), but cryptographic agility mechanisms cannot be used in a
   standalone manner. In order to deal with the aforementioned limitations,
   we propose a lightweight cryptographically agile agreement model, which
   is formally verified. We also present a solution in the Agile
   Cryptographic Agreement Protocol (ACAP) that can be adapted on various
   network layers, architectures and devices. The proposed solution is able
   to provide existing and new communication protocols with secure
   communication prerequisites in a straightforward way without adding
   substantial communication overhead. Furthermore, it can be used between
   previously unknown parties in an opportunistic environment. The proposed
   model is formally verified, followed by a comprehensive discussion about
   security considerations. A prototype implementation of the proposed
   model is demonstrated and evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{A novel feed system for circular arrays enabling beam steering over 360

   part is coupled with the elements of the circular array through a fixed
   coupling structure. The rotating part is light and its moment of inertia
   is significantly less than the conventional rotating antenna systems for
   beam scanning. Therefore, the beam can be steered much faster than the
   current rotating antenna systems. The details of the structure including
   the rotating and the fixed parts are presented and a design procedure

Abstract = {{Objective Develop a device-agnostic cloud platform to host diabetes
   device data and catalyze an ecosystem of software innovation for type 1
   diabetes (T1D) management.
   Materials and Methods An interdisciplinary team decided to establish a
   nonprofit company, Tidepool, and build open-source software.
   Results Through a user-centered design process, the authors created a
   software platform, the Tidepool Platform, to upload and host T1D device
   data in an integrated, device-agnostic fashion, as well as an
   application ({''}app{''}), Blip, to visualize the data. Tidepool's
   software utilizes the principles of modular components, modern web
   design including REST APIs and JavaScript, cloud computing, agile
   development methodology, and robust privacy and security.
   Discussion By consolidating the currently scattered and siloed T1D
   device data ecosystem into one open platform, Tidepool can improve
   access to the data and enable new possibilities and efficiencies in T1D
   clinical care and research. The Tidepool Platform decouples diabetes
   apps from diabetes devices, allowing software developers to build
   innovative apps without requiring them to design a unique back-end
   (e.g., database and security) or unique ways of ingesting device data.
   It allows people with T1D to choose to use any preferred app regardless
   of which device(s) they use.
   Conclusion The authors believe that the Tidepool Platform can solve two
   current problems in the T1D device landscape: 1) limited access to T1D
   device data and 2) poor interoperability of data from different devices.
   If proven effective, Tidepool's open source, cloud model for health data
   interoperability is applicable to other healthcare use cases.}},

Abstract = {{FootballAvatar is an experimental industrial research and development
   subproject of the project `SziMe3D-3D technological innovation in

   football avatar in the sense of information technology, though it has a
   strong mathematical background. However, we would like to apply it in
   several analytic and simulation software tools developed in our project.
   The main question is that how this notion could be implemented and used
   in several software environments including C++, Java, and R, or from an
   architectural viewpoint, on desktops, smart phones, and tablets, while
   the kinds of uses and the base definitions have often changed during the
   R\&D phases. This changing of the precise interpretation of the notion
   of ``football avatar{''} has a direct impact on selecting the software
   process model. For this reason, we have developed an own software
   methodology called Competitive Programming (CP), which will be presented
   in detail, as the main result of the present paper. Our main goal with
   CP was to create a methodology that allows us to work effectively even

Abstract = {{Linear dynamic models, due to their agile structure, are capable to
   follow and predict fast variations of real-world systems. On the other
   hand, recovering outcome signals of real-world systems is a
   straightforward approach to predict them. In this paper, potential of
   some dynamic linear models-including autoregressive (AR), autoregressive
   with exogenous inputs (ARX) models and their extended adaptive and
   evolving versions-are studied in signal recovering. At first, a common
   signal is represented as summation of some basic temporal functions
   named TMs (TMs); then, capabilities of the considered models are
   explained and compared in generating signals with different combinations
   of TMs. The given explanations and results are supported by theorems,
   Corollaries, illustrative examples and a real-world example of signal
   recovering. It is demonstrated that adaptive and particularly evolving
   AR and ARX models are more capable in signal recovering than regular AR
   and ARX models. Also, it is proved that if exogenous inputs as incoming
   signals of an ARX model were not available, under some constraints,
   there is an AR model which can produce the output of the ARX model. This
   result is extended for adaptive and evolving AR and ARX models, too.}},

Abstract = {{In the European manufacturing industry, production batches are

   One way for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to become more

   processes; larger enterprises already use this versatile piece of
   equipment for large batch sizes. To do so, a new perspective and

   decentralized control and distributed intelligence, linked through an
   extensible, flexible, and fault-tolerant communication architecture. The

   decentralized counterpart to illustrate some of the many advantages of
   this new system architecture. A manufacturing scenario analogue is

Abstract = {{Spectrally non-contiguous transmissions pose serious transceiver design
   challenges due to the nonlinear PA. When two or more non-contiguous
   carriers with close proximity are amplified by the same PA, spurious
   emissions inside or in the vicinity of the transmitter RF band are
   created. These spurious emissions may violate emission limits or
   otherwise compromise network coverage and reliability. Lowering the
   transmit power is a straightforward remedy, but it will reduce
   throughput, coverage, and power efficiency of the device. To improve
   linearity without sacrificing performance, several DPD techniques have
   recently been proposed to target the spurious emissions explicitly.
   These techniques are designed to minimize the computational and hardware
   complexity of DPD, thus making them better suited for mobile terminals
   and other low-cost devices. In this article, these recent advances in
   DPD for non-contiguous transmission scenarios are discussed, with a
   focus on mitigating the spurious emissions in the concrete example case
   of non-contiguous dual-carrier transmission. The techniques are compared
   to more traditional DPD approaches in terms of their computational and

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The growing adoption of agile methods of system development can be seen
   as broadly consistent with characteristics of a management fashion.
   However, the extent that fashions relate to how specific organizations
   actually adopt and use agile remains unclear. Based on five case
   studies, this research seeks to apply the concepts from management
   fashion theory to understand how organizations mindfully (or mindlessly)
   adopt agile methods. We find in some cases that agile appears to be
   characterized as a short-term, transitory trend, while in others it is
   embedded in an organization's processes and culture. We identify three
   categories that distinguish between fashion patterns during agile
   adoptions: Crusaders, who exclusively adopt agile in a pure form;
   Tailors, who integrate agile and traditional approaches to fit their

Journal = {{DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{150-161}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing has been widely adopted in
   recent years due to its inherent spectral efficiency and robustness to
   impulsive noise and fading. For cognitive radio applications in
   particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet
   suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading
   to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent
   OFDM-based standards such as IEEE 802.11p for vehicular communication
   and IEEE 802.11af for TV whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum
   emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter
   masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral
   efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these
   strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p
   and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling
   cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds
   baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the
   specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while
   allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a
   single basic channel without violating SEM specifications. The proposed
   method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict RF filter
   requirements, allowing the RF subsystem to be implemented using much
   less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions. (C) 2015

Pages = {{99-110}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This study considers the alignment of commodity-like goods in seafood
   networks by analysing the exchange economy embedded in a set of
   sequentially interdependent markets. A case study in seafood production
   is analysed from an end-to-end perspective in the flow of seafood from
   Norway to Japan to investigate how practitioners describe trading and
   the terminology used on trading embedded across the complete supply
   network. Four subcases that focus on how goods are traded are studied.
   Two subcases consider raw material supply, aquaculture-supplied salmon
   and wild-caught pelagic fish. The third subcase concerns the export of
   frozen mackerel to Japan, and the final subcase concerns seafood trading
   at a regional wholesale market in Japan. Analysis is based on the view
   that in supply an exchange (management) economy is distinct from a
   production (value-creation) economy, and these economies are
   interdependent. The fundamental importance of sequential
   interdependencies in seafood production is demonstrated. The four
   subcases are first analysed individually, applying relational
   contracting theory to understand patterns of exchange leading to
   transfer of title at markets. Developed relationships and trust, but
   also an acceptance of partner switching, characterizes exchange in all
   four market-related subcases. An understanding of how these loosely
   coupled markets may be viewed as aligned is developed. Markets emerge as
   nodes in the supply network with complex patterns of exchange
   facilitated by well-developed business relationships where a common norm
   is acceptance of disloyalty not impeding trust. These norms of exchange
   facilitate agile seafood distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Many enterprises that adopt Agile/Scrum suffer from collaboration issues

Abstract = {{Cloud computing enables a revolutionary paradigm of consuming ICT
   services. However, due to the inadequately described service
   information, users often feel confused while trying to find the optimal
   services. Although some approaches are proposed to deal with cloud
   service retrieval and recommendation issues, they would only work for
   certain restricted scenarios in dealing with basic service
   specifications. Indeed, the missing extent is that most of the cloud
   services are ``agile{''} whilst there are many vague service terms and
   descriptions. This paper proposes an agility-oriented and
   fuzziness-embedded cloud service ontology model, which adopts
   agility-centric design along with OWL2 (Web Ontology Language) fuzzy
   extensions. The captured cloud service specifications are maintained in
   an open and collaborative manner, as the fuzziness in the model accepts
   rating updates from users on the fly. The model enables comprehensive
   service specification by capturing cloud concept details and their
   interactions, even across multiple service categories and abstraction
   levels. Utilizing the model as a knowledge base, a service

   among user stories}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{58-76}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Context: Agile software development projects often manage user
   requirements with models that are called user stories. Every good user
   story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and
   testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an
   understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation
   of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding
   the context of a user story.
   Objective: We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of
   execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making
   use of business process models. The method associates user stories with
   the corresponding business process model activity element.
   Method: We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define
   our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed
   method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates
   a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process
   model can be used to infer information about the execution order and
   integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of
   association granularity: a user story can be more abstract,
   approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business
   process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of
   these three levels.
   Results: Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied
   comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the
   hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the
   hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater
   understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of
   user stories when associated business process models are available.
   Conclusions: We addressed a problem which arises from managing user
   stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing
   context of a user story. Our method contributes to the discipline of
   conceptual modeling in agile development. Our experiment provides
   empirical insight into requirement dependencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Context: Agile approaches are an alternative for organizations
   developing software, particularly for those who develop Web
   applications. Besides, CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)
   models are well-established approaches focused on assessing the maturity
   of an organization that develops software. Web Engineering is the field
   of Software Engineering responsible for analyzing and studying the
   specific characteristics of the Web. The suitability of an Agile
   approach to help organizations reach a certain CMMI maturity level in
   Web environments will be very interesting, as they will be able to keep
   the ability to quickly react and adapt to changes as long as their
   development processes get mature.
   Objective: This paper responds to whether it is feasible or not, for an
   organization developing Web systems, to achieve a certain maturity level
   of the CMMI-DEV model using Agile methods.
   Method: The proposal is analyzed by means of a systematic literature
   review of the relevant approaches in the field, defining a
   characterization schema in order to compare them to introduce the
   current state-of-the-art.
   Results: The results achieved after the systematic literature review are
   presented, analyzed and compared against the defined schema, extracting
   relevant conclusions for the different dimensions of the problem:
   compatibility, compliance, experience, maturity and Web.
   Conclusion: It is concluded that although the definition of an Agile
   approach to meet the different CMMI maturity levels goals could be
   possible for an organization developing Web systems, there is still a
   lack of detailed studies and analysis on the field. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   for coherent detection inmetro links beyond 100 Gb/s. Experiments are
   further conducted in a single-channel system with ECLs as the

   Although optical subwavelength switched networks have been attracting

   discuss optical switch requirements, the use of transceivers, and
   protection schemes to cost-effectively create large-scale reliable metro

   appropriate for optical subwavelength switched networks using our fast
   time-slot allocation algorithm. The proposed scheme periodically
   re-optimizes the bandwidth of both working and protection paths to
   prevent bandwidth resources from being wasted. The numerical examples

   dependencies in three typical cases of co-located agile software

Abstract = {{This work investigates whether the development methodology affects some

   characterize the development methodology using software metrics could be
   beneficial to developers who use agile approaches extensively.
   Therefore, this study sheds light on the metrics that might be highly
   affected by following agile approaches. The values of these metrics need
   to be tracked, because they might result in a quality-related issue,
   such as error-proneness, for example. The proposed approach employs
   different feature selection and classification methods, which include
   artificial neural networks. We used 11 object-oriented systems of
   various sizes and functionalities. Five of the used systems were
   developed using agile approaches, while the rest were developed using
   non-agile methodologies. The classes and methods of the used systems
   were represented by a set of metrics that shows some complexity,
   cohesion, and coupling features of the systems. The generated metrics
   are used as features to classify between the two different types of the

Abstract = {{Nowadays, it is commonly known that information systems need an agile
   capability of handling knowledge. To accomplish this, systems have to
   have a formal knowledge representation ability supported by specific and
   advanced reasoning features. This research work proposes a knowledge
   management approach with the purpose to gather, model and consume
   community knowledge for specific recommendation commitments. Such
   approach is accomplished by a semantic lexicon alignment between the
   various community knowledge assets, to facilitate collaborations
   establishment between people and systems in an interoperable fashion.
   Thus, a knowledge base supported by a thesaurus able to represent all
   the metadata needed to represent and characterize the various community
   stakeholders' resources is proposed. The thesaurus represents the
   lexicon in the domain, which in the ALTER-NATIVA systems is mostly used
   to support the various e-Learning elements (e.g. courses) and users
   categorization, sustained by synchronization features to facilitate a
   constant update of its information. A set of services designed to

Title = {{Automatic belief network modeling via policy inference for SDN fault
   localization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Fault localization for SDN becomes one of the most critical but
   difficult tasks. Existing tools typically only address a specific part
   of the problem (e.g., control plane verification, flow checker). In this
   paper, we propose a new approach to tackle SDN fault localization by
   automatically Modeling via Policy Inference (called MPI) the causality
   between SDN faults and their symptoms to a belief network. In the MPI
   system, a service oriented high level policy language is used to specify
   network services provisioned between end nodes. MPI parses each service
   provisioning policy to a logical policy view, which consists of a pair
   of logical end nodes, a traffic pattern specification, and a list of
   required network functions (or a service function chain). An SDN
   controller takes the policies from multiple parties and provisions the
   requested services on its orchestrated SDN network. MPI queries the
   controller about the network topology and retrieves flow rules from all
   SDN switches. MPI maps the policy view to the corresponding
   implementation view, in which all the logical components in the policy
   view are mapped to the actual system components along with the actual
   network topology. Referring to the component causality graph templates
   derived from SDN reference model, the implementation view of the current
   running network services can be modeled as a belief network. A heuristic
   fault reasoning algorithm is adopted to search for the most likely root
   causes. MPI has been evaluated in both a simulation environment and a
   real network system for its accuracy and efficiency. The evaluation
   shows that MPI is a highly scalable, effective and flexible modeling
   approach to tackle fault localization challenges in a highly dynamic and
   agile SDN network.}},

Abstract = {{Power efficiency is pressing in today's cloud systems. Datacenter
   architects are responding with various strategies, including capping the
   power available to computing systems. Throttling bandwidth has been
   proposed to cap the power usage of the disk drive. This work revisits
   throttling and addresses its shortcomings. We show that, contrary to the
   common belief, the disk's power usage does not always increase as the
   disk's throughput increases. Furthermore, throttling unnecessarily
   sacrifices I/O response times by idling the disk. We propose a technique
   that resizes the queues of the disk to cap its power. Resizing queues
   not only imposes no delays on servicing requests, but also enables
   performance differentiation. We present the design and implementation of
   PCAP, an agile performance-aware power capping system for the disk
   drive. PCAP dynamically resizes the disk's queues to cap power. It
   operates in two performance-aware modes, throughput and tail-latency,
   making it viable for cloud systems with service-level differentiation.
   We evaluate PCAP for different workloads and disk drives. Our
   experiments show that PCAP reduces power by up to 22\%. Further, under
   PCAP, 60\% of the requests observe service times below 100 ms compared
   to just 10\% under throttling. PCAP also reduces worst-case latency by
   50\% and increases throughput by 32\% relative to throttling.}},

Abstract = {{Gimbal-less two-axis quasistatic MEMS mirrors have the ability to
   reflect optical beams to arbitrary positions and with arbitrary
   velocity. This technology has become established in many applications
   including laser based tracking, 3D scanning, biomedical imaging,
   free-space communication, and LiDAR. However, for certain defense
   applications, the total angle x diameter product, or the mirror's
   effective achievable resolution (theta{*}D product), has not been large
   enough to address requirements for agile steering in large fields of
   regard and with a low diffraction-limited beam divergence. Two key
   limitations have been the relatively low forces available in
   electrostatic combdrive actuators and the susceptibility of
   large-diameter MEMS mirrors to shock and vibrations.
   In this work, we demonstrate that these same MEMS mirrors can have
   dramatically increased performance when fully immersed and packaged in
   dielectric liquids with highly favorable torque-increasing,
   damping-increasing, and optical gain-increasing properties. The rotating
   electrostatic combdrive has its torque multiplied by liquid's relative
   permittivity of similar to 2.5. Furthermore, by selecting the
   appropriate fluid viscosity, quality factor of the device is reduced and
   structural damping is tuned to near critical damping. Finally, the
   increased scan angle due to the similar to 1.5-1.7 index of refraction
   of the fluid is an additional benefit. These numerous benefits of the
   fluidic packaging enabled us to double and in some cases triple the
   previously achieved theta{*}D product of two-axis quasistatic MEMS
   mirrors while still maintaining speeds applicable for above mentioned
   applications. One of the most exciting benefits of the packaging
   methodologies is that the damping dramatically increases shock and
   vibration tolerance, which will be tested next.}},

Abstract = {{Agents and multi-agent systems are currently one of the most interesting
   research fields in the computer science community; especially the
   natural way of capturing the structure and the behavior of complex
   systems has stimulated this huge interest Lind (Issues in agent-oriented
   software engineering, 2000). As this paradigm advance, systematic
   methods are needed to support the development of multi-agent systems.
   General approaches for identifying, modeling, and analyzing user
   requirements for specific multi-agent software systems based on goal
   models have been suggested DeLoach (Multiagent systems engineering a
   methodology and language for designing agent systems, 1999), Tveit (A
   survey of agent-oriented software engineering, 2001). Nonetheless, those
   approaches suffer from rigidity and complexity for a customer to
   validate and review his needs as gathered by business analyst. In this
   paper, we present an agile requirements engineering approach to model
   multi-agent system requirements in the form of agent stories capturing
   skills and capabilities from the agent perspective. The agent stories
   can then be estimated, prioritized and traced separately. To illustrate
   the approach benefits, a Weapon Mass Destructive (WMD) system example is
   presented. The example is also used to compare our suggested approach
   with a goal-based one.}},

Abstract = {{Long-established Schumpeterian theory on innovation assumes that
   significant innovations are generated by large companies with ample
   spare resources. The allocation of time and money to speculative
   endeavours with unclear outcomes has often been regarded as beyond the
   scope of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As a result,
   authorities sometimes advise SMEs to concentrate on the adoption of
   existing innovative products and processes rather than the generation of
   new creative ideas. Despite this traditional wisdom, some very capable
   individuals actively choose to participate in the SME sector because the
   relative absence of internal bureaucratic processes and the capacity for
   agile response to changing circumstances. Ten case studies of
   significant technical innovations generated within construction SMEs
   were examined in the light of common themes identified through a
   literature review. The case studies were classified according to
   existing taxonomies of innovation. Content analysis was used to map the
   identified themes against the published material about the innovations
   from patent applications, company websites, trade literature and
   industry magazines. The findings indicate that SME innovation stems from
   several distinct motivations. These drivers of innovation can be
   described vectors. They inspire innovative solutions but the generated
   innovations also drive development towards solutions for other, quite
   different problems.}},

Abstract = {{Business development or renovation is to introduce newer, more efficient
   routines and processes through redesign or re-engineering of businesses,
   which form a set of business patterns. Business patterns encapsulate the
   best solutions for business practices and tasks confirming business
   strategies of the enterprise. Nowadays, services with SOA (Service
   oriented-Architecture) become more and more important in implementing
   and supporting business routines and processes. An enterprise that can
   encapsulate their SOA solutions into patterns will make the business
   more agile and effective. However, with the SOA solutions to automation
   of locating relevant instance services for its business patterns with
   minimum human intervention, one has to look into the semantic and
   operational difference between the description of a business pattern and
   that of an instance service - a gap between the two levels of
   descriptions. In this paper, the authors introduce a conceptual
   modelling method to address how to bridge the gap, by a semantic service
   description for usage contextual approach formalized with the conceptual
   graphs formalism. Most importantly, they evaluate this model in this
   paper to study its usability in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Agile software development generally refers to popular practices that
   are supposed to adhere to the Agile Manifesto with its values and
   principles. Empirical studies on agile software development have mainly
   focused on organizational adoption and impacts of agile practices.
   Furthermore, the literature on agile software development has mostly
   centered on small, co-located projects. However, agility is needed for
   software development projects of varied sizes in different organizations
   across industries. The general nature of agile values and principles and
   the procedure-driven nature of specific agile methods make it difficult
   for organizations to determine what they can do to effectively
   facilitate agility in their software development process. To bridge that
   literature gap and based on an evolved grounded-theory approach, this
   study identifies nine agility facilitators and their corresponding
   dimensions that extend beyond small, co-located projects to software
   projects of any size and distribution. These agility facilitators are
   further grouped into two categories: organizational foundation and
   project processes. In addition, the authors identify four dimensions of
   agility. The authors propose a framework that describes the
   organizational mechanisms through which the nine categories of
   facilitators lead to software development agility.}},

Abstract = {{There exist no concrete models for project size estimation in agile,

   requirements. Estimation in agile projects is important regardless of
   the immature nature of the requirements, on which they work. Next is the
   translation of effort estimates to project size or vice versa, which is
   equally important. Technique researched in this paper follows the user

   points with a story matter as well for correct size of story. There are

Abstract = {{The cost of software development is one of the major contributors to the
   development cost for safety systems in the petrochemical industry. It is
   hard to make developers work faster but it is possible to make them work
   more efficient. One way to achieve that is to introduce agile
   development methods. Agile methods are gaining increasing popularity in
   safety critical areas such as the petrochemical industry. Agile methods
   promise reduced costs and shorter time to market through incremental
   development, less production of unnecessary documents and more
   maintainable code. The IEC 61511: 2003 standard is normally used by the
   petrochemical industry. The second edition of this standard will be
   issued in 2015.
   Both the current and the new draft edition IEC 61511: 2014 of the IEC
   61511 standard are evaluated against agile development approach in this
   paper. Both editions of the IEC 61511 standard have a strong link to IEC
   61508. Manufacturers and suppliers of devices shall use IEC 61508, while
   system designers, integrators and users shall use IEC 61511. The IEC
   61508 standard's relationship to agile development has been evaluated
   with success in a previous paper (Stalhane 2012).
   While the architectural design also in agile development is done up
   front, detailed design is done incrementally. Based on reported
   experiences in other domains, we expect the following benefits:
   Easier to discover and correct faulty or incomplete system requirements
   Simpler software, thus reducing the development and maintenance costs
   Only documents that are needed, either for certification or development,
   are developed The ones that are developed are used and kept up-to-date
   Improved opportunities for reuse and site development.
   The challenge is to introduce agile development without compromising
   safety. Development of safety systems needs to be compliant with IEC
   61511. This standard impose rigor and additional costs, but proper
   adaptation of agile methods can add flexibility and efficiency. In order
   to evaluate this proposition we use a three step process:
   Go through all relevant requirements in the standard and mark all
   requirements as (1) fully met using agile development, (2) possible to
   meet using agile development and (3) cannot be fulfilled ``as is{''}
   using agile development.
   All requirements in category (2) are studied further in order to assign
   them to category (1) - OK, category (2) adaptations to the agile method
   by including add-on's or category (3) - changes to the development
   process.
   Suggest appropriate modifications to the agile development.
   This is the same process that we have used with success for IEC 61508
   (Stalhane 2012) and IEC 60880 (Stalhane 2013). The work on IEC 61508
   resulted in a method called SafeScrum. The SafeScrum model are reused
   and improved to fit the current and new edition of IEC 61511. There are
   no requirements in the current standards that prevents for an adjusted
   agile development process as SafeScrum.
   When the issues identified as category 2 in section 2 are settled, it
   should be straight forward to use SafeScrum and still be IEC 61511
   conformant. It is now important to get one or more companies to try it
   out in cooperation with the certification bodies and / or authorities to
   get a reality check of the concepts discussed. This will allow us to
   identify possible problems and to make the adjustments necessary for
   industrial application. The main challenges are the IEC 61511
   requirements on configuration management, traceability, detailed
   planning and documentation.
   However, in order to reap the full benefits of agile development, it is
   not enough to show conformance to IEC 61511. Suggested improvements of
   IEC 61511 are more requirements and information regarding modern
   software development methods. This is also in accordance with
   preliminary work performed by the current IEC 61508-3 maintenance
   committee.}},

   practices of both agile and traditional frameworks in a multi-model
   environment, using a pilot validation of the proposal for the
   requirement management process in SCRUM and CMMI-DEV 1.3. Such
   validation allowed us to analyze the catalogue structure behavior and

Abstract = {{The failure to meet production requirements, e.g., due to condition
   dynamic environment condition changes, operational performance
   deviations or missing opportunities to adapt, leads to a decrease of
   competitiveness. Technological advances are then required to promote
   flexible and adaptive systems with the ability to reconfigure their
   offered services in a cost effective manner. In spite of the current
   research efforts, there is still a lack of automated tools to support
   the service reconfiguration capability at run-time, being the
   understanding of when and how to reconfigure crucial to support an
   efficient reconfiguration process. This paper focuses on the problematic
   of when to reconfigure a system, with the proposed service-based
   multi-agent system performing the dynamic service reconfiguration based
   on triggering strategies. This allows to discover reconfiguration
   opportunities to maintain the system stable and competitive, but also to
   explore and promote new system configurations when needed. The envisaged
   triggering strategies, implemented through the intelligence mechanisms
   embedded in the agents' behaviors, consist in the event, periodic and

Abstract = {{Despite mobile medical apps becoming an increasingly important part of
   the healthcare industry, developers still find it challenging to
   understand what exactly is required when a mobile healthcare application
   fulfils the definition of a medical device both in terms of safety and
   security. To date, the authors have developed and piloted a medical
   device software process framework called MDevSPICE (R) that integrates
   processes from various medical device software standards as well as
   generic software development best practice standards. This paper
   describes current research that extends the MDevSPICE (R) framework to
   assist organizations developing mobile application software that meets
   the definition of a medical device and therefore has to be developed in
   compliance with medical device regulations. This can be a challenge for
   developers of mobile applications as such applications are normally
   developed in a much faster and less documented manner than traditional
   prescribed and plan driven medical device software development. We will
   describe our approach that increases the flexibility of the MDevSPICE
   (R) framework through replacing rigid plan-driven practices with agile
   practices that are more suitable for the development of mobile medical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The transformation of the American healthcare payment system from
   fee-for-service to value-based care increasingly makes it valuable to
   develop patient registries for specialized populations, to better assess
   healthcare quality and costs. Recent widespread adoption of Electronic
   Health Records (EHRs) in the U.S. now makes possible construction of
   EHR-based specialty registry data collection tools and reports,
   previously unfeasible using manual chart abstraction. But the
   complexities of specialty registry EHR tools and measures, along with
   the variety of stakeholders involved, can result in misunderstood
   requirements and frequent product change requests, as users first
   experience the tools in their actual clinical workflows. Such
   requirements churn could easily stall progress in specialty registry
   rollout. Modeling a system's requirements and solution design can be a
   powerful way to remove ambiguities, facilitate shared understanding, and
   help evolve a design to meet newly-discovered needs. ``Agile
   Modeling{''} retains these values while avoiding excessive unused
   up-front modeling in favor of iterative incremental modeling. Using
   Agile Modeling principles and practices, in calendar year 2015 one
   institution developed 58 EHR-based specialty registries, with 111 new
   data collection tools, supporting 134 clinical process and outcome
   measures, and enrolling over 16,000 patients. The subset of UML and
   non-UML models found most consistently useful in designing, building,
   and iteratively evolving EHR-based specialty registries included User
   Stories, Domain Models, Use Case Diagrams, Decision Trees, Graphical
   User Interface Storyboards, Use Case text descriptions, and Solution
   Class Diagrams.}},

Abstract = {{Planning is an integral part of agile software project management.
   Several agile software planning tools were developed; they grow in
   number and complexity. Our analysis of 30 of the most known agile
   planning tools shows that while the majority of them support the key
   agile planning activities, they still have limitations. In this paper,
   we presented three limitations to the current agile planning tools and
   we developed three features to overcome them. A questionnaire is used to
   evaluate the identified limitations and the proposed features. The
   evaluation shows that the identified limitations are sound and exist in
   the real software projects. In addition, most of the participants agree
   about how to implement the first and second proposed features (providing
   task effort notification and improving user story prioritization). The
   evaluation of the third feature (adding new user story/re-prioritize
   user story by customer) shows that the simple implementation provided
   for this feature is not sufficient and, hence, there is a need for a
   more thorough study to best involve customers through agile planning
   tools. This research contributes in developing advanced agile planning
   tools supporting the key agile planning activities.}},

Abstract = {{Assembly workload and human labor is the main expense factor during the
   assembly of products. Here, the hours of work by workmen multiplied with
   a company-specific factor equal the occurring costs. The assembly
   planning of single productions or short runs is often based on
   experience or the method of compare and estimate. In this paper an
   aproach is presented, in which the assembly planning is put into
   practice based on engineering 3D CAD models translated in 3D PDF and a
   preplanned library of work steps. Through connected time values
   multiplied by frequency and under consideration of assembly
   difficulties, transparent assembly base-times can be calculated and
   expectable costs can be estimated. Through connected resources the
   needed tool-use per workstation can be determined. Furthermore, a
   connection of product, assembly process and resource is implicitly
   created by the planning process itself, which machinereadable will
   provide a lot of potential for future automatisms.}},

Abstract = {{A goal of the industrial internet is to make information about
   manufacturing processes and resources available wherever decision making
   may be required. Agile use of information is a cornerstone of data
   analytics, but analytical methods more generally, including model-based
   investigations of manufacturability and operations do not so easily
   benefit from this data. Rather than relating anonymous patterns of data
   to outcomes, these latter analytical methods are distinguished as
   relying on conceptual or physics-based models of the real world. Such
   models require careful consideration of the fitness of the data to the
   purpose of the analysis. Verification of these analyses, then, is a
   significant bottleneck. A related problem, that of ascertaining
   reproducible results in scientific claims, is being addressed through
   executable notebook technology. This paper proposes to use notebook
   technologies to address that bottleneck. It describes how this notebook
   technology, linked to internet-addressable ontologies and analytical
   metamodels, can be used to make model-based analytical methods more
   verifiable, and thus more effective for manufacturers.}},

Abstract = {{Communication networks are changing. They are becoming more and more
   ``software-based.{''} The use of Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
   to run network services in software enables Software Defined Networks
   (SDN) to create a largely software-based network. To truly achieve the
   vision of a high-performance software-based network that is flexible,
   lower-cost, and agile, a fast and carefully designed network function
   virtualization platform along with a comprehensive SDN control plane is
   needed.
   Our high-performance NFV platform, OpenNetVM, enables high bandwidth
   network functions to operate at near line speed, while taking advantage
   of the flexibility and customization of low cost commodity servers.
   OpenNetVM exploits Intel's DPDK libraries to minimize the overhead of
   packet processing, and to provide high throughput, low latency
   networking in virtualized environments. OpenNetVM allows true zero-copy
   delivery of data to VMs, both for packet processing and highspeed
   inter-VM communication through shared huge pages within a trust
   boundary. We envision a dynamic and flexible network that can support a
   smarter data plane than just simple switches that forward packets. We
   build on our OpenNetVM NFV platform by developing our SDNFV network
   architecture that supports complex stateful routing of flows where
   processing by network functions (NFs) can dynamically modify the path
   taken by flows, without unduly burdening the centralized SDN controller.
   The tutorial will also briefly touch upon the problem of dynamic
   placement of network functions and routing of flows through a software
   based network, exploiting a mixture of centralized SDN control and NFV
   capabilities in the network. The problem can be formulated as a mixed
   integer linear programming problem, and heuristics can be used to solve
   the problem incrementally.
   As a case study, we examine the growing communication needs of
   `Internet-of-Things' (IoT). With `smart' sensing devices becoming
   ubiquitous, there is a need to support IoT communication at large scale,
   especially over cellular networks. The use of NFV platforms for the
   Evolved Packet Core, we see opportunities for supporting IoT
   communications at large scale in 5G cellular networks. We will describe
   potential solutions in this direction.}},

   center interconnects. It uses a digital micromirror device (DMD) and
   mirror assembly combination as a transmitter and a photodetector on top
   of the rack as a receiver (Figure 1). Our approach enables all pairs of
   racks to establish direct links, and we can reconfigure such links
   (i.e., connect different rack pairs) within 12 mu s. To carry traffic
   from a source to a destination rack, transmitters and receivers in our
   interconnect can be dynamically linked in millions of ways. We develop
   topology construction and routing methods to exploit this flexibility,
   including a flow scheduling algorithm that is a constant factor
   approximation to the offline optimal solution. Experiments with a small
   prototype point to the feasibility of our approach. Simulations using
   realistic data center workloads show that, compared to the conventional
   folded-Clos interconnect, our approach can improve mean flow completion
   time by 30-95\% and reduce cost by 25-40\%.}},

   Agility and leanness philosophies based on the range of products and
   services are provided by the organization. This paper focuses on the
   agility for services provided by SCM based organization. Since in every
   system there is fuzziness in its structure and function. The functional
   fuzziness can be easily reduced and compared to structural fuzziness. In
   this paper different methods based on fuzzy decision methods are
   compared for strategy development. Each service provided by organization
   is mapped with SCM strategies. From this set of services, optimal
   service is selected. This paper explains a case study of an organization
   working on SCM strategies. To find optimal service, different decision
   methods like Saaty's method, minimization of maximal regret method, AHP
   method, ranking method, and fuzzy average weighted method are compared
   to measure relativity of fuzziness in multiple objective frameworks by
   structuring the system hierarchically. This paper also shows advantages

Abstract = {{The wonderful evolutions of recent decades in the field of
   computer-mediated communication undoubtedly has made e-commerce as a
   certain assumption. In the field of e-commerce, the use of powerful
   software systems and providing business needs has great importance for
   survival. Agile methods ensure the ``acceleration of time to market{''},
   ``customer satisfaction{''} and ``high quality of software{''}.
   Selection of an appropriate agile method is based on a complex and
   multicriteria decision which can have excellent consequences on the
   success of e-commerce systems. Engineering method is a method and
   engineering regulations that aims to design, construct and adaptation of
   methods, techniques and tools to develop information systems. Increasing
   development of Engineering Method and public welcome for constructing
   coincident methods and special for a private project, or an organization
   or a general method that fits the characteristics and needs of the
   software team, existence of right and systematic frameworks, codified
   rules and proper guidelines in process of method production are of the
   challenges that nowadays specialist of method engineering face with.
   This paper presents a framework for generalization of agile methods
   based on requirements for e-commerce applications which include three
   phases of starting, construction of methodology and ending and each
   phase includes a number of stages. The purpose of the proposed framework
   is to categorize and assess the needs of e-commerce and examination of
   present techniques and patterns in agile methods and selection of
   appropriate patterns to improve base agile method for e-commerce
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and evaluate a novel architecture enabling high-capacity,
   resource efficient and agile elastic optical networks. It is based on
   sliceable bandwidth-variable transponders and optical white box switches
   which route optical signals without filtering them. Instead of using
   active filtering components, each node is equipped with an optical white
   box based on a programmable optical switch that serves as an optical
   backplane. It provides interconnections between input/output ports and
   passive splitters and couplers. Due to signal broadcast and the absence
   of filtering (so-called drop-and-waste transmission), some of the
   signals appear on unintended links which can lead to an overhead in
   spectrum usage. To address this issue, we formulate the problem of
   signal routing, modulation format and spectrum assignment in
   programmable filterless networks based on optical white boxes as an
   integer linear program (ILP) with the objective to minimize the total
   spectrum usage. Simulation results indicate that our proposed solution
   obtains a beneficial tradeoff between component usage and spectrum
   consumption, using a drastically lower number of active switching
   elements than the conventional networks based on hard-wired
   reconfigurable add/drop multiplexers, and lowering the maximum used
   frequency slot by up to 48\% compared to existing passive filterless
   networks.}},

Title = {{Supplier/partner selection in agile supply chain Application of vague
   set as a decision making tool}},
Journal = {{BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{866-892}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The concept of agile supply chain (ASC) has become
   increasingly important as means of achieving a competitive edge in
   turbulent business environments. An ASC is a dynamic alliance of member
   enterprises, the adaptation of which is likely to introduce velocity,
   responsiveness and flexibility into the manufacturing system. In ASC
   management, supplier/partner selection is a key strategic concern;
   influenced by various agility-related criteria/attributes. Therefore,
   evaluation and selection of potential supplier in an ASC has become an
   important multi-criteria decision-making problem. The purpose of this
   paper is to report, a supplier selection procedure (module) in the
   context of ASC.
   Design/methodology/approach - During supplier selection, subjectivity of
   evaluation information (human judgment) often creates conflict and bears
   some kind of uncertainty. To overcome this, the present work attempts to
   explore vague set theory to deal with uncertainties in the supplier
   selection decision-making process. Since, vague sets can provide more
   accurate information as compared to fuzzy sets. It considers true
   membership function as well as false membership function which give more
   superior results for uncertain information. In this procedure, first,
   linguistic variables have been used to assess appropriateness rating
   (performance extent) as well as priority weights for individual
   quantitative or qualitative criterions. Second, the concept of degree of
   similarity and probability of vague sets has been used to determine
   appropriate ranking order of the potential supplier alternatives.
   Findings - A case empirical example has been provided. It has been
   proved that the methodology would be fruitful in considering different
   evaluation criterion (indices); may be contradicting in nature like
   beneficial and cost criterions. The application of vague set theory has
   also been proved as a better option to work under uncertain (fuzzy)
   decision-making environment in comparison to fuzzy set theory.
   Originality/value - The application of vague set theory in
   multi-criteria group decision making has been reported in literature to
   a limited extent. Application of vague set as a decision-making tool in
   agile supplier selection appears relative new and unexplored work area.
   The work has got remarkable managerial implications.}},

Abstract = {{Agile methodologies are becoming widespread in modern software
   development. However, due to a lack of safety assurance activities,
   agile methods are criticized for being inadequate for the development of
   safe software. Safety analysis and safety verification are complementary
   methods for safety assurance. Yet, both usually rely on traditional,
   waterfall-like processes. Therefore, it is strongly needed to integrate
   an appropriate safety analysis approach into agile software development
   processes driving architecture design and verify the safe design at the
   code level.
   This paper presents a novel agile process model ``S-Scrum{''} based on
   the existing development process ``Safe Scrum{''} and extended by a
   safety analysis method and a safety verification approach based on STPA
   (System-Theoretic Process Analysis).
   The proposed agile development process S-Scrum can be separated into
   three parts: (1) performing safety-guided design by STPA inside each
   sprint. (2) Verifying safety requirements at the code level by using
   model checking. (3) Replacing traditional RAMS (Reliability,
   Availability, Maintainability, Safety) validation on the final product
   by STPA safety analysis. We adopt other aspects from the original Safe
   Scrum.
   Finally, the feasibility of S-Scrum is illustrated with the example of
   an airbag system.}},

Abstract = {{User feedback is an important means of validating requirements and
   discovering new requirements in continuous software evolution. However,
   users have a low motivation to provide feedback and prefer applications

   developers have difficulties to analyze feedback, and to integrate it
   into their development work.
   In this paper, we describe CAFE, a context-aware feedback system which
   consists of: (1) a framework for collecting in-situ user feedback
   enriched with usage context data; and (2) a process for integrating
   feedback into a team's development activities. While the process is
   applicable to all kinds of applications, the implemented framework
   concentrates on mobile user feedback and its particular challenges.
   We evaluated CAFE in a mobile application. Our results indicate that the
   system is a valuable step toward increasing user motivation to provide
   feedback and decreasing the developers' effort to integrate feedback,
   ultimately improving user involvement.}},

Abstract = {{Agile development methodologies encourage frequent releases. However,
   many releases can overwhelm clients, testers and users if they do not
   understand what the actual difference is between two versions. Every
   release raises questions like whether they need to update right away,
   whether functionality has been added or problems have been fixed and
   finally whether it is worth their time to try out a new version.
   Release notes can alleviate this problem by informing their audience
   about the contents of a particular release, but the creation of high
   quality release notes takes time and effort. A release manager needs to
   have the release's target audience in mind, access information from
   project management, issue tracker, and build system and might even need
   input from designers and developers.
   We describe a semi-automated approach for generating targeted,
   informative release notes. Our solution is designed from the point of
   view of a release manager who acts as an editor of auto-generated
   content based on information gathered from both build server and issue
   tracker. Furthermore, it allows release notes to be tailored to a
   specific audience depending on their specific information needs.}},

Abstract = {{Airbus DS GmbH has developed a Ka-band antenna assembly which offers
   steerable up-/downlink connections (receive, transmit) for satellites in
   low earth orbit (LEO). The antenna consists of a dual reflector antenna
   and a mechanical steering mechanism. The pointing mechanism comprises
   the steering unit, a standardised azimuth stage and an elevation stage,
   which is custom-made.
   The Ka-band antenna assembly (KAA) is part of the antenna pointing
   assembly (APA) product family by Airbus DS GmbH. The steerable antenna
   system KAA was completely developed in Germany.
   The antenna has to fulfill strict requirements concerning gain,
   sidelobes and polarisation purity and the agile steering mechanism needs
   a highly stable and symmetric structure of the antenna. Therefore the
   antenna is designed as a centre-fed dual reflector antenna. The
   engineering model successfully passed all qualification tests. The
   antenna was optimised by means of a hybrid approach and different
   calculation techniques. In this paper both the components, Ka-band

Abstract = {{Design considerations for agile, precise and reliable attitude control
   of micro-spacecraft using Adaptive Singularity free Control Moment
   Gyroscope (ASCMG) actuators are presented here. A complete dynamics
   model of a spacecraft with an ASCMG is derived using the principles of
   variational mechanics, relaxing some assumptions made in prior
   literature on Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMG). The dynamics so obtained
   shows the complex nonlinear coupling between the internal degrees of
   freedom associated with an ASCMG and the spacecraft base body's attitude
   motion. By default, the general ASCMG model is equivalent to that of a
   Variable Speed Control Moment Gyroscope without symmetrical rotor and
   gimbal, and can operate as a CMG by spinning the rotor at constant
   speed. This dynamics model is then extended to include the effects of
   multiple ASCMGs placed in the spacecraft bus, and sufficient conditions
   for non-singular ASCMG cluster configurations are obtained to operate
   the cluster in CMG mode. The adverse effects of the simplifying
   assumptions that lead to the standard CMG design, and how they lead to
   CMG singularities, are described. A bare minimum hardware prototype of
   an ASCMG using low cost COTS components, is shown. A control scheme for
   agile and precise attitude pointing control of a cubesat using a finite
   number of ASCMGs in the absence of external torques, is presented. A
   Geometric Variational Integration scheme is obtained for this multibody
   spacecraft for numerical and micro-controller implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Agile practices have gained increasing popularity in Information
   Technology (IT), Education, Marketing, and Advertising industry, as it
   brings quality products into the market faster. Scrum, Lean Development,
   and Extreme Programming are the most commonly considered processes under
   the Agile umbrella. Scrum or scrum variants form a high performance,
   collaborative team to handle projects that are more complex. We examine
   the applicability of the scrum framework to a large-scale revenue
   management system for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). Industry believes
   integration and acceptance testing is not easy to perform within the
   scrum framework. Nevertheless, very little is explored about the
   acceptance testing in Agile practices. We fill this gap by empirically
   evaluating UAT of a complex, large-scale system (in a public sector
   organization) to showcase the applicability of scrum framework. While
   the initial UAT team consisted of 100 domain experts, no process was
   defined for the UAT. This made it easier to streamline the UAT into the
   scrum framework. Once the scrum framework was introduced significant
   improvements in the UAT team was experienced with improved morale,
   productivity, efficiency, and time to market while having a smooth flow.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - In the rapidly changing business environment, companies must
   align with suppliers to streamline operations, as well as working
   together to achieve a level of agility beyond individual companies (Lin
   et al., 2006). Today's more dynamic business environment increases the
   need for greater agility in supply chains, which increases both the
   importance and frequency of supplier/partner evaluation and benchmarking
   decision making. The purpose of this paper is to develop a multiple
   criterion appraisement index (model/module) for supplier/partner
   alternative firm benchmarking perspective under similar agile supply
   chain architecture.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this reporting, evaluation information
   against subjectivity (uncertain environment) indices has been
   transformed mathematical dimensionless numbers by fuzzy-based
   computation module. A new interval-valued fuzzy number set conjunction
   with modified ``technique for order preference by similarity to ideal
   solution{''} methodology has been explored from benchmarking (ranking
   order of firm under similar criterion) point of view of supplier firms.
   Findings - In this context, a novel ``fuzzy mathematical equation{''}
   has been developed in perceptive to compute the priority weights and
   appropriateness ratings of first-level measures which reduced the
   acquisition of supplementary priority weights and appropriateness
   ratings assessment in linguistic terms from group decision makers (DMs)
   for first-level indices. An empirical case study has been carried to
   ranking order the candidate partner/supplier alternative via collective
   index (CI) value. Lower value of ``CI{''} reflected higher degree of
   performance extent. The authors found out the effectiveness and validity
   of proposed methodology for constructed appraisement module.
   Originality/value - This research work shall be valuable for that
   organization which volunteer to obtain the ranking order of
   partner/supplier alternative (benchmark) under similar agile supply
   chain architecture in accordance to group DMs' comprehensive information
   for select best one supplier for own firm. In this reporting, a novel
   fuzzy mathematical equation has been developed in order to compute the
   important weights as well as priority rating of first-level
   indices/measure which reduced the supplementary important weights and
   priority rating assessment from group DMs in linguistic terms in order
   to obtain the measures rating and weights.}},

Title = {{Supply chain value stream mapping: a new tool of operation management}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY \& RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{518-534}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The issue of the supply chain has been given much attention in
   recent decades, both in the academic arena as well as in the business
   world. It has become so important that organizations have begun to
   directly manage the supply chain, appointing specific managers to
   perform this function. New challenges now include a focus on supply to
   determine the right time and place for product delivery. Some authors
   indicate a close relationship between Total Quality Management and the
   supply chain regarding its philosophical and operational goals and
   perspectives. Lee (2004) goes even further by indicating that only
   organizations that devise agile, adaptable and aligned supply chains
   will be able to continue competing in today's environment. Therefore,
   observing and measuring the supply chain at all times is critical for
   today's organizations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the
   implementation of a tool called Supply Chain Value Stream Mapping
   (SCVSM) in order to thoroughly understand competitive priorities of
   volume and delivery (On-time Delivery (OTD)) for any supply chain in
   organizations.
   Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory case study was conducted.
   Two manufacturing company which have been established in Mexico with a
   robust supply chain for at least 20 years, were selected. The paper
   chronicles the implementation of SCVSM in both case studies. Three
   methods were used to gather data: direct observation; documentary
   analysis and semi-structured interviews.
   Findings - This paper proposes a new tool for operation management
   called SCVSM. Its development, refinement and applied in both case
   studies. The evidence shows that it is possible to apply the tool
   (SCVSM) to visualize the variables volume and OTD in supply chains. In
   consequence, this research has made a small empirical contribution to
   the theoretical field of supply chain quality management.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper has the same limitations
   as all other case-study-based research, including analysis subjectivity
   and questionable generalization of findings. There may well also be a
   theoretical gap in the geographic region because the paper only analyzes
   two companies established in Mexico.
   Practical implications - Derived to describe both case studies on how to
   apply the SCVSM tool it may prove to be of value to practitioners and
   managers involved in the field. Similarly, a section on managerial
   implications has also been included.
   Originality/value - The study contributes to the limited existing
   literature on the Supply Chain Quality Management and subsequently
   disseminates this information in order to provide impetus, guidance and
   support toward increasing the development companies in an attempt to
   move the Mexico manufacturing sector toward world class manufacturing
   performance.}},

Title = {{Supply chain agility in humanitarian protracted operations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HUMANITARIAN LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{173-201}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend the concept of agility
   in humanitarian logistics beyond emergency operations. Since the
   humanitarian logistics literature focuses primarily on emergencies and
   sees longer term and regular operations as being conducted in relatively
   stable and predictable environments, agile practices are usually not
   associated with humanitarian protracted operations. Therefore, this
   paper explores the logistics and supply chain environment in such
   operations in order to identify their basic features and determine if
   agility is an important requirement.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a case study of the United Nations
   World Food Programme, the authors collected and analysed qualitative and
   quantitative data on the characteristics of protracted operations, the
   risks and uncertainties most frequently encountered, their impact, and
   the ways that field logisticians manage contingencies.
   Findings - The research demonstrates that unpredictability and
   disruptions exist in protracted operations. Therefore, short-term
   operational adjustments and agile practices are needed in order to
   support the continuity of humanitarian deliveries.
   Research limitations/implications - Future research should focus on a
   wider range of humanitarian organisations and move from a descriptive to
   a prescriptive approach in order to inform practice. Notwithstanding
   these limitations, the study highlights the need for academics to
   broaden the scope of their research beyond emergencies and to address
   the specific needs of humanitarian organisations involved in longer term
   operations.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first empirical research focusing
   exclusively on the logistics features of humanitarian protracted
   operations. It provides a more concrete and complete understanding of
   these operations.}},

Abstract = {{Computational Mechanics (CM) concerns the use of computational methods
   to study phenomena under the principles of mechanics. A representative
   CM application is parameter sweep experiments (PSEs), which involves the

   are processed via virtual machines (VM) that are lauched in hosts
   belonging to different datacenters, minimizing both the makespan and
   flowtime. Scheduling is performed at three levels: a) broker, where
   datacenters are selected based on their network latencies via three
   policies, b) infrastructure, where two bio-inspired schedulers based on
   Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for
   VM-host mapping in a datacenter are implemented, and c) VM, where jobs
   are assigned into the preallocated VMs based on job priorities.
   Simulated experiments performed with job data from two real PSEs show

Title = {{Modeling Lean implementation for manufacturing sector}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{405-426}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this research paper is to identify the enablers
   for Lean implementation in the manufacturing sector, to establish a
   relationship among them using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and
   to rank them using interpretive ranking process (IRP).
   Design/methodology/approach - The research paper presents a blend of
   theoretical framework and practical applications. In the paper, eight
   enablers of Lean production are identified from literature survey and
   experts' opinion. These include 5S, value stream mapping (VSM), just in
   time, single minute exchange of die, computer-integrated manufacturing,
   concurrent engineering, training and enterprise resource planning. ISM
   is used to obtain a structural relationship among these enablers of
   Lean. MICMAC analysis is used to identify the driving power and
   dependence of the variables. Further, IRP is used to rank the lean
   enablers with respect to key performance areas.
   Findings - The ISM- and IRP-based models indicate that ``training{''} is
   the most significant factor for the Lean implementation process in
   manufacturing sector. The MICMAC analysis also shows that ``training{''}
   has the maximum driving power and the least dependence and hence has
   strong managerial significance. The management should place high
   priority on tackling this criterion. VSM occupies the top level in the
   ISM hierarchy, indicating that all other Lean enablers should act in
   unison to make VSM implementation a success.
   Originality/value - Enablers are the building blocks for deployment of
   the Lean concept. To know the key enablers and relationship among them
   can help many organizations to develop Lean competencies. This study is
   perhaps among the first few that focuses on two modeling procedures
   based on interpretive logic, i.e. ISM and IRP. The paper provides useful
   insights to the Lean production implementers, consultants and
   researchers.}},

Abstract = {{Today's military radars are being challenged to satisfy multiple mission
   requirements and operate in complex, dynamic electromagnetic (EM)
   environments. They are simultaneously constrained by practical
   considerations like cost, size, weight and power (SWaP), and lifecycle

   operating environments and capable of doing more with fewer resources.
   Radar research supports this shift toward more agile and efficient radar
   systems, and current trends include modular hardware and software
   development for multi-purpose, scalable radio frequency (RF) solutions.
   Software-defined radios (SDRs) and other commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)

   Software Architecture during Global Software Development}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Requirement change management (RCM) is a critical activity during
   software development because poor RCM results in occurrence of defects,
   thereby resulting in software failure. To achieve RCM, efficient impact
   analysis is mandatory. A common repository is a good approach to
   maintain changed requirements, reusing and reducing effort. Thus, a
   better approach is needed to tailor knowledge for better change
   management of requirements and architecture during global software
   development (GSD). The objective of this research is to introduce an
   innovative approach for handling requirements and architecture changes
   simultaneously during global software development. The approach makes
   use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and agile practices. Agile practices
   make our approach iterative, whereas CBR stores requirements and makes
   them reusable. Twin Peaks is our base model, meaning that requirements
   and architecture are handled simultaneously. For this research, grounded
   theory has been applied; similarly, interviews from domain experts were
   conducted. Interview and literature transcripts formed the basis of data
   collection in grounded theory. Physical saturation of theory has been
   achieved through a published case study and developed tool. Expert
   reviews and statistical analysis have been used for evaluation. The
   proposed approach resulted in effective change management of
   requirements and architecture simultaneously during global software
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Agile software development has been one of the most important paradigms
   of software engineering community. Agile methods that are shaped around
   Agile Manifesto and principles, provide promising results when applied
   properly in software organizations. Agile assessment models and tools
   have potential to indicate agile adoption problems at project level or
   organization level. In the scope of this study, we identified 37 agility
   assessment tools. Among those tools, we evaluated 11 agility assessment
   tools based upon 9 criteria within a multiple case study. The purpose of
   this study is to evaluate existing agility assessment tools to provide
   an overview about potential uses, advantages and drawbacks. The results
   of the case study indicate that none of the 11 tools are eligible to
   fully achieve the 9 criteria.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of software development has evolved considerably in recent
   decades, with new programming technologies, the affordability of
   hardware, pervasive internet access and mobile computing all
   contributing to the emergence of new software development processes. The
   newer process initiatives, which include those which are sometimes
   referred to as agile or lean methods, have brought with them new terms,
   which sometimes reflect the introduction of novel concepts. Other times,
   new terms correspond to long established concepts that have been
   repackaged. The net position is that we have a proliferation of language
   and term usage in the software development process domain, a problem
   which has implications for assessors and assessment frameworks, and for
   the broader community. In this paper, we explore this problem, finding
   that it is worthy of further research. Plus, we identify a technique
   suited to addressing this concern: the establishment of a canonical

Abstract = {{A major problem for distributed Scrum teams is proper communication
   between the involved parties to ensure the quality of the final product.
   This is especially true for coordination issues such as sharing
   requirements, time schedules, to-dos and code artefacts. Hence,
   ScrumMasters complain frequently about software tools not suiting their
   daily needs when supporting agile teamwork, finally leading to the fact
   of not using a Scrum tool at all. In this paper we describe the
   extensive interviews held with selected ScrumMasters in which they
   explained their current tools and the existing gap to their real needs.
   Within this context, they were able to define the features and aspects
   they really need. After collecting those requirements for their daily
   work, we extracted the most wanted ingredients, prioritised them and
   finally forged them into an Open Source tool called Scrumpy, helping us
   to present a first solution, which focuses on the agile philosophy of
   Scrum and the elements needed most by ScrumMasters. Features of Scrumpy
   include, for example, web-based access to the task board with real-time
   updates, advanced dashboard visualisation techniques and a sophisticated
   chat system, which enables effortless communication for distributed
   teams. Although we already have first anecdotal feedback from users, we
   plan to improve the tool in a next step by adding more commodity
   features, perform additional mobile usability tests and systematically
   evaluate Scrumpy with a large number of end users.}},

Abstract = {{{[}Context] Many software projects fail due to problems in requirements

   specific and relevant RE problem in detail: incomplete/hidden
   requirements. {[}Method] We replicated a global family of RE surveys
   with representatives of software organizations in Austria and Brazil. We
   used the data to (a) characterize the criticality of the selected RE
   problem, and to (b) analyze the reported main causes and mitigation
   actions. Based on the analysis, we discuss how to prevent the problem.
   {[}Results] The survey includes 14 different organizations in Austria
   and 74 in Brazil, including small, medium and large sized companies,
   conducting both, plan-driven and agile development processes.
   Respondents from both countries cited the incomplete/hidden requirements
   problem as one of the most critical RE problems. We identified and
   graphically represented the main causes and documented solution options
   to address these causes. Further, we compiled a list of reported
   mitigation actions. {[}Conclusions] From a practical point of view, this

Abstract = {{Planning in supply chains is characterized by uncertainties. These can
   be disruptive as well as operational risks, but also business
   opportunities. To deal with uncertainties, various approaches suggest
   supply chains that are robust, resilient, and agile (RoRA). To
   accomplish this, flexibility is necessary. Aspects of flexibility in
   supply chain management (SCM) have been analyzed from different angles.
   But still a holistic concept on how flexibility planning can be
   integrated in the process of supply chain planning does not exist. This
   paper gives an overview on optimization models used for flexibility
   planning in supply chains and identifies the characteristics of such a
   planning process. Which tasks of SCM the components of flexibility
   planning have to be integrated in is discussed along the structure of
   the supply chain planning matrix. An outlook on further research on
   flexibility planning in RoRA-SCM is also given.}},

Abstract = {{The paper focuses on problem of detection of an agile target a rocket,
   using passive radar. The main problem under consideration is improvement
   of detection capabilities of the radar by extending the integration
   time. As the target has small radar cross-section, any increase in
   signal-to-noise ratio is desirable. This can he achieved by extending
   the integration time used in the calculation of the crossambiguity
   function. This, however, is limited by the simplified model of target
   echo used in classical crossambiguity function and its mismatch with the
   actual target motion. The rocket observed by the radar accelerates very
   fast, which leads to the so-called velocity cell migration phenomenon,
   which limits the possible signal-to-noise ratio increase. In the paper
   extended crossambiguity function taking into account target acceleration
   is considered. The results of the algorithm are presented on data from
   DVB-T-based passive radar used for detection of a one-stage supersonic
   rocket.}},

   Design/methodology/approach - The 15 SCPs are identified based on the
   literature support and opinion of industry experts and academia, and
   data were collected from 292 organizations. Data were analyzed using the
   statistical package for the social science software to see the current
   level/penetration of SCPs in Indian manufacturing organizations.
   Findings - The practices, namely, organizational culture, customer
   relationship, information and communication technology, benchmarking and
   performance measurement, lean manufacturing, agile manufacturing,
   supplier relationship are highly penetrated practices in Indian
   manufacturing organizations. The practices, namely, outsourcing,
   information sharing, just in time manufacturing, green supply chain
   management are moderately penetrated practices, while the practices,
   namely, reverse logistics, postponement, vendor managed inventory, radio
   frequency are least penetrated practices in Indian manufacturing
   organizations.
   Research limitations/implications - Further study can be extended to see
   the of penetration practices applicable to service and agriculture
   sectors.
   Practical implications - The result of this paper will enable the
   organizations to identify and direct their focus on the areas that
   requires improvement. Also, the organizations will become more aware of
   the SCPs that will help in boosting up their performance and
   competitiveness and indirectly boost the growth and contribute to
   India's economic development.
   Originality/value - This is the first kind of study which checked the
   level of selected SCPs in Indian manufacturing organizations.}},

Title = {{LARG index A benchmarking tool for improving the leanness, agility,
   resilience and greenness of the automotive supply chain}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to suggest a lean, agile,
   resilient, and green (LARG) index as a benchmarking tool to assess the
   leanness, agility, resilience and the greenness of the automotive
   companies and corresponding supply chain (SC).
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed index incorporates LARG
   supply chain management paradigms and corresponding practices being both
   weighted according to their importance for the automotive SC
   sustainability. The Delphi technique is used to obtain the weights for
   each SC paradigm and a linear aggregated method is proposed. A case
   study approach related to the automotive SC is chosen to illustrate the
   LARG index application.
   Findings - The case study results confirmed the usefulness and ease of
   application of LARG index in a real world SC. The application of the
   suggested index to a set of companies, and consequently to their SC,
   makes possible to identify: the better and worst performer company in
   each paradigm, the LARG practices with higher levels of application
   among the companies, the LARG index for each company and also for the
   corresponding SC. This becomes an important benchmarking tool since
   comparative analysis regarding the LARG behaviours are possible to
   perform with the suggested index.
   Research limitations/implications - More LARG practices could be
   considered to improve the robustness of the index. Future studies should
   be conducted across more companies for improving the effectiveness of
   the approach, and more members should be included in the panel of Delphi
   technique for enhancing the validity of the suggested approach.
   Practical implications - SC companies will be able to assess their
   performance in terms of leanness, agility, resilience and greenness. A
   study like this could encourage all automotive companies to benchmark
   their organizations as regards their competitors, the best in class, and
   also the industry average.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature by
   introducing a new index for measuring the leanness, agility, resilience
   and greenness of companies and SCs. This index can be used by managers
   as a benchmarking tool to identify their LARG behaviour and compare it
   with their SC partners and seek for improvement.}},

Title = {{A multicriteria model on calculating the Sustainable Business Excellence
   Index of a firm with fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS}},
Journal = {{BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1522-1557}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated
   methodology for benchmarking the sustainability of organizations. The
   fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and technique for order of
   preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods have been
   used for this purpose. The FAHP is used to determine the weights of the
   criteria by decision makers, and the rankings of the alternatives are
   determined by TOPSIS. The proposed instrument is used to calculate the
   Sustainable Business Excellence Index (SBEI) and its potential impact on
   the formulation of firm strategy. To demonstrate the applicability of
   the model, illustrative examples are presented.
   Design/methodology/approach - After a careful literature review, a
   sustainable business excellence framework is created and a fuzzy system
   is developed to assess firms' sustainability. Finally, the SBEI is
   computed.
   Findings - The results indicate that the suggested fuzzy approach is
   feasible for benchmarking the sustainability of organizations. It allows
   the decision makers to express their opinion regarding the importance of
   criteria and evaluate each alternative and then have this input
   coordinated in a quantitative fashion.
   Research limitations/implications - Practitioners and consultants can
   use the instrument for conducting quality management benchmarking within
   and across organizations. Researchers can use the instrument in future
   studies for further theory development in this area.
   Originality/value - As far as the authors are aware, no previous study
   research has assessed the SBEI of an organization with fuzzy sets. As
   such, it responds to a number of contemporary challenges in the business
   excellence theory, most importantly the broad need to identify agile
   organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Requirements engineering establishes that requirements definition
   process must be applied to obtain, validate and maintain one or more
   requirement documents. This process handles different stakeholders
   expectations and viewpoints, among them, the software designer whose
   responsibility is to create software models from information provided by
   domain experts and business specialist. However, due to knowledge
   differences between stakeholder's technical dialects, communication
   problems are constant, generating inconsistencies between the conceptual
   model and the problem to be solved. To help solving these issues an
   agile and cognitive modeling based approach supported by MDA based tools
   is proposed promoting better consistency between requirements and the
   conceptual models, guaranteed by specifying a mind map that serves as
   the basis for translating requirements to domain models, represented by
   the UML class diagrams and feature models. Thus, the main contribution
   of this work is to provide an interoperability tool to generate software
   models (e.g.: class diagrams and feature models) from mind maps. This
   tool provides the capability of transformation between different
   industrial mind map tools (including cloud tools -SaaS) to different
   domain modelling tools, both class diagrams and for feature models.
   Finally, a case study was applied to verify this feasibility and check
   this interoperability assessment. The main contribution is MindDomain

Abstract = {{Conducting research and development (R\&D) software projects, in an
   environment where both industry and university collaborate, is
   challenging due to many factors. In fact, industrial companies and
   universities have generally different interests and objectives whenever
   they collaborate. For this reason, it is not easy to manage and
   negotiate the industrial companies' interests, namely schedules and
   their expectations. Conducting such projects in an agile framework is
   expected to decrease these risks, since partners have the opportunity to
   frequently interact with the development team in short iterations and
   are constantly aware of the characteristics of the system under
   development. However, in this type of collaborative R\&D projects, it is
   often advantageous to include some waterfall practices, like upfront
   requirements modeling using UML models, which are not commonly used in
   agile processes like Scrum, in order to better prepare the
   implementation phase of the project. This paper presents some lessons
   learned that result from experience of the authors in adopting some
   Scrum practices in a R\&D project, like short iterations, backlogs, and
   product increments, and simultaneously using UML models, namely use

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS \& PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{923-947}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate high-involvement
   and short-term supply relationships, known as agile supply partnerships
   (ASPs), and explores the conditions that support the development of such
   inter-organizational relationships.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative exploratory research design
   was followed, based on in-depth case studies of Italian fashion footwear
   manufacturers and their relationships with key suppliers.
   Findings - ASPs appear to be most relevant in supply material categories
   which have a high impact on the appearance or functionality of the
   product. Conversely, in supply categories with a low impact, long-term
   partnerships are preferred. Four main characteristics of ASPs are
   identified: they are part of a portfolio of relationships to balance the
   rigidities of long-term strategic partnerships; they have project-like
   features; they are developed from a network of pre-qualified suppliers;
   they are recurring and intermittent rather than continuous or isolated
   one-off short-term partnerships.
   Research limitations/implications - The research has been carried out in
   the context of an Italian footwear district. Further research is
   required to evaluate the validity of the propositions in other sectors
   and geographies.
   Practical implications - The research can help decision makers in the
   fashion industry, and potentially other sectors affected by high
   turbulence, to identify when ASPs are most appropriate and what
   characteristics they should have.
   Originality/value - This research contributes to the literature on
   agility by empirically evaluating the apparent paradox related to the
   specific characteristics of supply relationships required to foster an
   agile strategy and by clarifying the conditions under which fashion
   companies develop ASPs.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Armies around the world face the dilemma of reaching the right
   size of the logistics chain, without compromising the effectiveness of
   it. The stocking of spares for maintaining the equipment and the
   vehicles of the army is done with just in case philosophy which results
   in huge inventories that have associated holding and carrying costs.
   Material managers of the army must learn lessons from the industry about
   rightsizing their inventories. Concepts like lean and agile must find
   place in managing spares of army. Both these concepts have their
   inherent positives which must be exploited by making use of them at the
   opportune time. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper starts with discussing the case
   study of spare parts supply of army. The paper then presents a framework
   where both lean and agile methods of managing inventory can be used in
   army. The paper also brings out salient aspects of both these concepts
   as relevant to spares management in army. The paper also proposes use of
   automation incorporating MIMOSA database and Ontology-based knowledge
   repositories.
   Findings - The paper brings out the fact that both lean and agile supply
   chains can be used for spares replenishment in army. The paper also
   gives out a framework to implement the concept.
   Originality/value - This concept has been used in the field of
   healthcare, however, this paper is original in its approach to use it
   for the army spare parts replenishment. Use of Ontology and MIMOSA as
   proposed in the paper is also an original attempt.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-99}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the underlying
   strategic mechanisms of agility in a humanitarian logistics context.
   Based on the research conducted in business disciplines, the paper
   empirically examines a set of four strategic dimensions (being
   purposeful, being action-focused, being collaborative, and being
   learning-oriented) and identifies an emergent relationship between these
   capabilities and agile humanitarian logistics operations.
   Design/methodology/approach - Leadership and management actions
   perceived to support the four capabilities were identified and used as a
   basis to complete the exploratory research. Specifically, a case study
   with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) was undertaken and,
   in this context, a qualitative analysis of 29 face-to-face interviews
   with humanitarian logistics experts working for WFP was conducted.
   Findings - The research corroborates the relevance of the four
   strategic-level capabilities to the humanitarian logistics context and
   confirms that these capabilities play a role in the development of
   agility in humanitarian operations. The work also identifies a set of
   key strategic decision-making areas that relate to the building of
   agility.
   Research limitations/implications - Additional research is needed to
   further investigate and measure the strategic-level capabilities and to
   quantify their impact on operational agility. Further research should
   also be undertaken to extend this study to a wider range of humanitarian
   organisations.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first empirical research that
   takes a strategic approach to the concept of agility in humanitarian
   logistics. It highlights that the leaders and managers of humanitarian
   organisations have a significant role to play in the building of an
   agile system.}},

   as minimizing upfront investment costs and maximizing learning so as to
   reduce uncertainty and risk for future iterations. {[}Ideas] This short

   gamification to improve stakeholder engagement and ultimately
   performance in RE. We focus on agile requirements that are expressed as
   user stories and acceptance tests. {[}Principal ideas/results] We
   develop the gamified requirements engineering model (GREM) that relates
   gamification, stakeholder engagement, and RE performance. To evaluate
   GREM, we build an online gamified platform for requirements elicitation,
   and we report on a rigorous controlled experiment where two independent
   teams elicited requirements for the same system with and without
   gamification. The findings show that the performance of the treatment
   group is significantly higher, and their requirements are more numerous,
   have higher quality, and are more creative. {[}Contribution] The GREM
   model paves the way for further work in gamified RE. Our evaluation
   provides promising initial empirical insights, and leads us to the
   hypothesis that competitive game elements are advantageous for RE

Abstract = {{R\&D projects, unlike existing System Integration (SI) projects or
   software development projects, are ambiguous in their goal or the
   resolution methods in order to reach that goal. It also has limits in
   having applied the waterfall model, repeated and incremental spiral
   models, or agile methodology which is usually applied to System
   Integration projects or software development projects. In order to
   overcome these constraints, this paper defined the various forms of work
   products generated across the entire cycle of the R\&D project, their
   major keywords and core sentences as the Research Descriptor, and
   through a project management based on the content, an analysis of the
   semantics of the content that composes the WorkProducts, a
   semantic-based test and traceability were supported. By monitoring the
   project quality metric, the paper suggests a Research Descriptor based
   project management approach that can be applied to R\&D projects with
   ambiguous goals or resolution methods.}},

Abstract = {{Despite strong market interest in speciality foods, producers find

   includes a literature review and five case studies of supply chains
   relating to shellfish, cheese, meat, potato and miscellaneous speciality

   configuration parameters from the extant literature, and these are used
   to analyse the cases. The study makes three main contributions to the
   literature: an analytical framework for analysing the supply chain
   characteristics of speciality foods; important supply chain factors for
   accessing the conventional food supply chain; and five propositions for
   improving market access. We argue that the speciality foods supply chain
   should be configured according to these propositions to ensure
   responsiveness to customer needs and to strengthen market access.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{4065-4080}},
Abstract = {{Lean supply chain management is well established, effective in improving
   inventory control as well as leading to greater quality. Continuous
   improvement obtained from lean implementation is expected to lead to
   better learning, yielding added profitability over time. However, the
   growth of global supply chains lead to increased complexity and
   variability, which may not always favour the lean management style.
   Impact on total cost is often difficult to precisely estimate, in part
   due to high levels of uncertainty with respect to disaster and
   catastrophe, changing governmental regulation around the world, and in
   part due to increased variability from longer supply lines. We examine
   some of the cost impacts of lean systems vs. outsourcing policies with
   assumed purchasing cost advantages through simulation of a global supply
   chain with detailed inventory factors, and compare relative profit
   impact. These results are used to argue that in some circumstances
   strategic considerations such as lower purchasing cost can override
   short-term inventory savings obtained from lean systems.}},

Title = {{A contemporary TOC innovative thinking process in the backdrop of
   leagile supply chain}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{400-431}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a fresh perspective to
   effectively adopt leagility in supply chain. The research adopts Theory
   of Constraints (TOC) methodology and amalgamates it with design thinking
   process, people's opinion andmathematical approach to help achieve
   supply chain leagility.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed framework is a seven stepped
   approach to achieve supply chain leagility combination analytical and
   mathematical procedures. Data enveloping analysis (DEA) is used to
   identify high level constraint. The new designed thinking process is
   used to further evaluate the constraints. Nominal group technique (NGT)
   is used to help build the current reality tree and identify detail level
   constraints.
   Findings - The framework application on a case supply chain improves
   various parameters of leanness and agility over a period of one year.
   Improvements include reduced rework, improved cash flow, reduced
   operating cost, reduced order backlog and better customer interaction.
   Research limitations/implications - This research opens up TOC
   application in a totally new area of leagility adoption in supply chain.
   The framework needs to be explored with more implementation in various
   business scenarios. Practical implications - The proposed framework is
   extremely intuitive and pragmatic in approach. The case application
   demonstrates the framework can be easily adopted by supply chain
   managers to improve leagility.
   Social implications - The current study attempts to diversify the TOC
   application. Using thinking process, DEA and NGT in TOC parlance brings
   in objectivity and employees together for improvement.
   Originality/value - Amalgamating the mathematical approach of DEA,
   design thinking process and NGT within the TOC framework for supply
   chain leagility is new and novel.}},

Abstract = {{The textile industry in Europe consists mainly of small and medium
   enterprises (SME), which are a vital part of the European Union economy.
   The SMEs are pressured by a challenging financial situation and must
   become more efficient to stay competitive. Many textile SMEs have,
   however, not adopted new quality management concepts for efficiency;
   this represents an interesting research gap. Hence, the purpose of this
   paper was to investigate the effects of a lean approach in the
   management area of textile SMEs. The findings suggest overall positive
   effects as a result of applying lean principles in the textile
   management area. Several areas, characterised as waste in a lean service
   context, were improved. This suggests possible cost reduction with a
   lean approach. From a team perspective, improvements of team
   collaboration, information and communication as well as team performance
   were identified. A conflicting finding was that work-related stress
   increased in one case, while it was reduced in the other case.}},

Journal = {{PRODUCTION PLANNING \& CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{7-8, SI}},
Pages = {{579-590}},
Abstract = {{Supply chain resilience is often perceived as highly desirable, as it
   increases a firm's readiness in dealing with risks that can emerge from
   the customers' side, the suppliers' side, the internal processes adopted
   and the supply chain integration mechanisms employed. However, though
   practitioners responsible for the design and management of supply
   networks often see resilience as highly desirable, they also see the
   direct trade-off being cost. An in-depth qualitative single case is
   presented in this study, using an iterative cycle between theory and
   practice to delve into the experiences of the case company and various
   concepts from the literature. A framework for the development and
   implementation of a resilient supply chain strategy is proposed, which
   illustrates the relevance of various management paradigms (robustness,
   agility, leanness and flexibility) in increasing a company's ability to
   deal with disturbances emerging from its supply chain. The paper
   advances theory and closes some of the gaps in the literature with
   regard to the ways certain management paradigms could be combined in
   practice in order to develop a supply chain resilience strategy.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{65-79}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides practical insights into the success criteria in
   agile projects in the Norwegian software industry. We conducted 32
   interviews with practitioners working with agile projects. The findings
   revealed two fundamental differences that distinguish the perception of
   success in agile projects from that in projects that are based on the
   waterfall approach. Firstly, the evaluation is carried out on a regular
   basis after each increment. This regular and continuous measurement of
   success contributes several advantages, including greater commitment and
   involvement from the customer and a higher level of mutual trust between
   the supplier and the customer; and thus leads to better knowledge
   sharing and reduced task uncertainty. The reduction of task uncertainty
   provides more predictability about the direction of the project and
   better grounds for change control; not least, it allows room to consider
   multiple and subjective assessments by various stakeholders. Secondly,
   there is a stronger emphasis on customer satisfaction. Customer
   satisfaction is measured in terms of how quickly the customer obtains
   value from the project. The continuous assessment of success at the end
   of each iteration also has a significant, positive impact on the
   customer's evaluation of the project outcome.}},

   e-manufacturing principles is aimed at integration of computer models of
   physical objects and processes. This change requires a deep

Pages = {{381-396}},
Abstract = {{Developing decision support systems for emergency situations is a
   complex and challenging task. These difficulties are compounded further
   in the case of cross-border emergencies, which often require the
   coordination and collaboration of independent agencies. These agencies
   have different structures and resources in place, and follow their own
   internal policies and procedures. If a number of countries have been
   affected, agencies may not even share the same language. Large-scale
   disasters, whether natural, deliberate, or accidental do not respect
   borders and come with a high risk to human life and a variety of
   economic and health impacts. Thus, it is the aim of the S-HELP
   (Securing-Health Emergency Learning Planning) project to develop a
   decision support tool-set that supports multi-agency decision-making
   during cross-border emergencies. S-HELP seeks to provide a tool-set that
   supports rapid and effective decision-making across all stages of the
   emergency management lifecycle (i.e. mitigation, preparedness, response,
   and recovery). To address the challenges associated with multi-agency
   emergency management, a holistic framed approach to healthcare
   preparedness, response, and recovery is proposed. This holistic
   framework has been created to guide the development of the S-HELP
   solution. The framework integrates a number of components important in
   the phased iterative development of an emergency management decision
   support system, such as, interoperability standards, risk communication,
   spatial data management, agile development, healthcare responder
   training, and scenario development for system evaluation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DECISION SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{421-435}},
Abstract = {{Intuition, which ranges in style from affective to inferential to
   holistic (Pretz et al. 2014) can play a central role in decision-making,
   as decision makers must often balance intuition with rational analytical
   thinking. This paper explores the influence of intuition based decision
   style diversity on both the emergence of transactive memory systems
   (TMS) and team performance in an entrepreneurial setting. The
   uncertainty of an entrepreneurial setting leads to a greater emphasis on
   intuitive thinking in the team context. However, intuition as a basis
   for decision-making manifests itself in a variety of forms. And not all
   forms of intuitive tendencies lend themselves to a team decision-making
   context that is cohesive, or to decisions that are strategically
   coherent. Given that a diversity of intuitive tendencies is likely to be
   found in every team setting, and as such may exert a considerable
   influence on the decision-making process, we develop hypotheses in order
   to investigate the nature of this influence. Drawing on data collected
   from 188 participants across 22 countries and split into 48
   entrepreneurial ICT teams, our findings show strong support for the
   influence of intuitive decision style diversity on both team level
   states and team performance. The explanatory model developed has
   significant implications for contemporary understanding of
   decision-making teams, deep-level diversity, the entrepreneurial
   process, and TMS research.}},

Abstract = {{Software development is increasingly heading in the direction of
   combining agile software development practices and outsourcing software
   development to external vendors worldwide. The resulting agile global
   outsourced software development (AGOSD) projects are characterized by
   applying agile methods to distributed environments, which results in
   several problems for collaboration and coordination. Specifically,
   communication between the project participants has been found to be a
   major challenge in distributed environment. Therefore, our study
   investigates the problem of improving communication in distributed
   settings by identifying suitable communication practices for usage
   within AGOSD projects. Based on an extensive literature review, our
   study (1) provides an overview of adequate practices for usage in AGOSD
   and (2) points out differences to traditional communication practices of
   agile software development (ASD) projects used in collocated,
   non-distributed environments.}},

Abstract = {{Agile development for big data analytics has become the new normal.

   development? This article contributes an Architecture-centric Agile Big
   data Analytics (AABA) development methodology evolved and validated in
   10 case studies through Collaborative Practice Research. Our studies
   showed that architecture agility is the key for successful agile big
   data analytics development. Employing an architecture-centric approach,
   the AABA methodology integrates the Big Data system Design (BDD) method
   and Architecture-centric Agile Analytics with architecture-supported
   DevOps (AAA) model for effective value discovery and rapid continuous

   investigating the occurrence of technical debt in critical software
   development projects. The results of an exploratory field study
   conducted across several projects reveal that a variety of business and
   environmental factors cause the occurrence of technical debt in critical
   domains. Using Grounded Theory method, these factors are categorized as
   ambiguity of requirement, diversity of projects, inadequate knowledge
   management, and resource constraints to form a theoretical model.
   Following previous studies we suggest that integrating agile practices,
   such as iterative development, review meetings, and continuous testing,
   into common plan-driven processes enables development teams to better
   identify and manage technical debt.}},

Abstract = {{DevOps is a predominant phenomenon in the web domain. Its two core
   principles emphasize collaboration between software development and
   operations, and the use of agile principles to manage deployment
   environments and their configurations. DevOps techniques, such as
   collaboration and behaviour-driven monitoring, have been used by web
   companies to facilitate continuous deployment of new functionality to
   customers. The techniques may also offer opportunities for continuous
   product improvement when adopted in the embedded systems domain.
   However, certain characteristics of embedded software development
   present obstacles for DevOps adoption, and as yet, there is no empirical
   evidence of its adoption in the embedded systems domain. In this study,
   we present the challenges for DevOps adoption in embedded systems using
   a multiple-case study approach with four companies. The contribution of
   this paper is to introduce the concept of DevOps adoption in the
   embedded systems domain and then to identify key challenges for the
   DevOps adoption.}},

   ontology-based software by defining application scenarios and activities
   to develop the software and ontology. Furthermore, the aim is also to
   improve the collaboration and communication between software engineers
   and ontology engineers. OntoSoft has been applied to develop an

Abstract = {{Falls represent a major problem in the public health care domain,
   especially among the elderly population. Therefore, there is a
   motivation to provide technological solutions for assisted living in
   home environments. We introduce a neurocognitive robot assistant that
   monitors a person in a household environment. In contrast to the use of
   a static-view sensor, a mobile humanoid robot will keep the moving
   person in view and track his/her position and body motion
   characteristics. A learning neural system is responsible for processing
   the visual information from a depth sensor and denoising the live video
   stream to reliably detect fall events in real time. Whenever a fall
   event occurs, the humanoid will approach the person and ask whether
   assistance is required. The robot will then take an image of the fallen
   person that can be sent to the person's caregiver for further human
   evaluation and agile intervention. In this paper, we present a number of
   experiments with a mobile robot in a home-like environment along with an
   evaluation of our fall detection framework. The experimental results
   show the promising contribution of our system to assistive robotics for
   fall detection of the elderly at home.}},

   of change in operations and technology, it is critical to look for new
   strategies to acquire IT for defense systems. Over the last decade,
   agile software development emerged as a leading model across industry
   with growing adoption and success. Agile is centered on small
   development Teams delivering small, frequent releases of capabilities,
   with active user involvement. From a planning and execution viewpoint,
   agile emphasizes an iterative approach with each iteration informing the
   next. The focus is less on extensive upfront planning for entire
   programs and more on responsiveness to internal and external changes,
   such as operations, technology, and budgets. Based on US and Italian
   experiences, this paper discusses some of the common challenges in
   implementing agile practices and recommended solutions to overcome these
   barriers.}},

Abstract = {{The application of the ``Agile{''} methodology to a Military Application
   Software production line is not to be taken for granted. The adoption of
   the new production style has implied the solution of multiple problems
   and the generation of a custom version of the basic ``Scrum{''} theory.
   One of the major changes has been imposed by the need to include
   Military Test Beds and Military Units in the workflow. Even if the
   ``Agile Scrum{''} methodology has been around for over a decade now,
   there are many successful implementation stories the Italian Army
   experience and clearly show there is more conceptual work to be done.
   There are a number of open issues to be tackled and a growth potential
   to be exploited. AMINSEP tackles the area of monitoring and measuring
   using noninvasive tools (Italian Army choice) necessary to keep high the
   product quality level and monitor criticalities. Those tools need to
   evolve. The evolution has to take into account the peculiar environment
   of the agile teams. The current tools are based on complexity metrics
   borne for the old fashion software factories. The collected data do not
   give a complete picture of the team-based code development cycle. A new
   set of metrics is needed to complement the existing ones. The basic
   concept and the structure of the research project are presented.}},

   the introduction of a more structured decision support method in agile
   development should lead to a higher level of comfort with the products

Abstract = {{Even though the use of Open Source Software (OSS) might seem paradoxical
   in Defense environments, this has been proven to be wrong. The use of
   OSS does not harm security; on the contrary, it enhances it. Even with
   some drawbacks, OSS is highly reliable and maintained by a huge software
   community, thus decreasing implementation costs and increasing
   reliability. Moreover, it allows military software engineers to move
   away from proprietary applications and single-vendor contracts.
   Furthermore, it decreases the cost of long-term development and
   lifecycle management, besides avoiding vendor's lock in. Nevertheless,
   deploying OSS deserves an appropriate organization of its life cycle and
   maintenance, which has a relevant impact on the project's budget that
   cannot be overseen. In this paper, we will describe some of the major
   trends in OSS in Defense environments. The community for OSS has a
   pivotal role, since it is the core development unit. With Agile and the
   newest DevOps methodologies, government officials could leverage OSS
   capabilities, decreasing the Design (or Technical) Debt. Software for
   Defense purposes could perform better, increase the number of the
   releases, enhance coordination through the different IT Departments (and

   Therefore, as in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, being

   underpinning requirements of Agile Methodologies whose inherent nature
   suggests that profitable results can be achieved when agile practices
   are absorbed into Modeling and Simulation projects. As a matter of
   facts, a lot of common ground can be found if well established M\&S
   principles are evaluated against agile practices or vice versa. Indeed,
   agile software development, likewise simulation, relies on human and
   technical factors management along the project life cycle. Needless to
   say that it is not a surprisingly achievement, given that simulation
   building blocks are pieces of software components integrated with one
   another. However, it is worth noticing that simulation can provide the
   groundwork to assess and validate the effects of agile practices and in
   turn can substantially strengthen its methodological foundations
   benefiting from advances and best practices in software engineering. To
   this end, a case study in military logistics will be presented in this
   paper showing that high-quality results can be achieved applying agile
   techniques for simulation model development.}},

Abstract = {{The need to improve the timescale and cost performance of C2 weapon
   system has led MBDA to identify a new way to deliver C2 weapon system
   based on a product line approach. An international MBDA team has been
   set up to identify commonalities in any command and control application
   within the air defence scope. This work led to an open architecture that
   encapsulates elements that depend on weapon system specificities by the
   ones that are common. The common elements, covering surveillance, threat
   evaluation, weapon assignment and engagement control functions within
   the wide MBDA's set of effectors, have been developed using MBDA
   Internal Research Funding and now are used to build up next-generation
   C2 solutions. The extendible concept behind the framework architecture
   allows the use of the `MBDA Extendible C2' during the initial phases of
   the contract (assessment phase, derisking, demonstrator, research) and
   for the deployment phase by providing the possibility for closed-loop
   feedback within the customer. The need to work collaboratively across
   nations leads to the design and delivery of the MBDA Collaborative
   Environment (or CEM) solution that is a collaborative engineering
   virtual laboratory for members who are located in separate sites. This
   environment is protected, which therefore enables the efficient sharing
   of data between Italy and other entities. This environment is a
   desktop-virtualization-based technology that creates a cohesive and
   scalable solution and centralizes the Italian infrastructure. This
   reduces development time as it allows real-time development and review
   of design artefacts, reducing the risk of duplication of effort. It
   reduces development risk of misunderstanding due to parallel development
   activities. Furthermore, it reduces time and costs of information

Abstract = {{Fata Informatica is a software house that produces a commercial system
   widely used by Defence Organizations. Our first approach to software
   development was standard waterfall, but during the years, our team
   adopted an agile-driven approach. The agile adoption was a long sweaty
   path that lead us through the Shu-ha-ri Aikido stages and let us
   implement our own agile framework. In this contribution will be shown as
   Fata Informatica's team defines the product increments that add the more
   value to the customers, how they develop and deliver them into the
   market. A description of our value and cost evaluation and the way we
   choose which increments add to a specific delivery, Fata Informatica's
   agile approach to the stakeholder engagement and how the static roadmap
   concept is outdated by a more agile roadmap definition approach will
   also be shown in order to meet the increasingly needs of our

   in software engineering where uncertainty of the functions to implement

   difficulty of the software production phase was tackled by the
   requirement engineers using formal methods to structure the dialogue
   with the user. The solutions offered by this discipline are
   controversial. Agile methods put once again the human factor at the
   center of the user needs capture phase, using the intrinsic nonlinearity
   of the human mind to translate the user stories into software
   development. Although this practice has a positive outcome, the built-in
   ambiguity of the natural language is a consistent limit. An attempt to
   structure this dialogue without disturbing the ``Agile{''} approach is
   presented, and some considerations on the possibility of using semantic
   tools are made.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-25}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to understand and identify the various
   barriers in adopting new telecom services in rural areas for improving
   the penetration and revenue of the telecom companies. These barriers are
   modeled to study their inter-relationships and prioritize them for
   strategizing appropriate management action plans.
   Design/methodology/approach - Delphi technique has been used to form a
   consensus with the telecom managers working in rural areas to finalize
   the barriers. An integrated Interpretive Structural Modeling-Analytic
   Network Process (ISM-ANP) approach has been adopted to establish the
   complex relationships, cluster the relationships, to understand and
   prioritize the telecom service adoption barriers.
   Findings - The major contribution of this research is imposing
   directions and dominance of various barriers to promote better adoption
   of new telecom-based mobile services in rural areas. The proposed
   integrated method can aid in decision making by providing more
   informative, accurate and a better choice than using either ISM or ANP
   in isolation.
   Research limitations/implications - The generalizabilty of these
   research findings is limited, as it was generated specific to rural
   telecom service adoption barriers in Indian context. Because
   decision-making problems are usually complex and ill-structured, every
   decision is based on the decision-maker's expertise, preferences and
   biasness of the experts who showed their interest to participate in the
   research.
   Practical implications - This paper forms the basis of identifying the
   reasons for poor adoption of telecom-based mobile services in rural
   India. This study would help the telecom companies and the managers to
   understand and develop strategies to target the rural audience by
   introducing action plans and innovative mobile services to overcome the
   identified barriers. By applying the proposed methodology, telecom
   companies can classify and prioritize their action plans as short-,
   medium-and long-term plans to systematically overcome the identified
   barriers.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a base for understanding various
   factors that affect the adoption of telecom-based mobile services. It
   demonstrates the use of an innovative approach to develop an integrated
   model to understand the barriers.}},

Journal = {{STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{16-22}},
Abstract = {{Software architecture stands as the backbone of any software system,
   regardless of the methodology it was developed with. The responsibility
   for the choice of the architectural solution, its design and evaluation
   in the traditional development process lies in the role of the software
   architect. Traditional architecture development is based on three
   architectural phases: architectural analysis, architectural synthesis
   and architectural evaluation. The highly ceremonial character of the
   traditional process is also reflected in the role of the software
   architect, who is responsible for generating numerous architectural
   artefacts.
   The proponents of agile development start from the position that an
   architecture emerges gradually, after every iteration, as a result of
   continuous code refactoring, rather than from a previously built
   structure. In accordance with this, agile processes do not contain any
   of the traditional phases (the analysis, the synthesis and the
   evaluation) of the architecture development process. Agile processes
   also have a different view of the responsibility for a developed
   architectural solution, delegating it to all the members of the agile
   team.
   In terms of expanding agile development processes with traditional
   architecture processes, with the aim of enabling the development of a
   complex system, the current research and efforts have also identified
   change in the role of the software architect. This paper aims to
   describe the modified role of the software architect in agile processes
   for developing complex software solutions, integrating findings of the
   existing literature and the results of the conducted empirical research.
   The empirical research results feature as a part of the research
   conducted within the doctoral dissertation entitled ``The Methodological
   Framework for Developing the Software Architecture of Business Software

Abstract = {{Many forces have combined to make today's supply chains more complex

Abstract = {{In this letter, a design of a beam-sweeping antenna using a new active
   frequency selective surface (FSS) is presented. The active FSS is
   composed of a steerable hybrid element that allows the control of
   radiation characteristics of the proposed antenna. The design is
   composed of an active cylindrical FSS structure containing PIN diodes
   and is divided into 10 equal columns. This design contains a simple
   dipole that is located in the center and surrounded by a cylindrical
   active FSS. The beam-sweeping of the antenna is produced by switching
   the PIN diodes between the ON and OFF states. The antenna operates at
   1.8 GHz and covers all azimuth angles in 10 steps with a maximum
   measured gain of 9.1 dBi. This beam-switching antenna can be used in the
   base stations of wireless communication systems.}},

Title = {{Ambidextrous supply chain as a dynamic capability: building a resilient
   supply chain}},
Journal = {{MANAGEMENT DECISION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-23}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Developing ambidexterity as a dynamic capability is important
   for firms to sustain their competitive advantage. Moreover, this
   capability allows firms to build the resiliency to mitigate enterprise
   risks. The purpose of this paper is to apply two main theoretical frames
   from the strategy literature, dynamic capabilities, and organizational
   ambidexterity, to supply chain management (SCM) to examine mitigation
   strategies for supply chain (SC) disruptions. The authors empirically
   investigated how the firm's SC ambidexterity is developed through a
   dynamic capability-building process and how this, in turn, can mitigate
   the negative impact of SC disruptions and improve business performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study conducted a field survey to
   answer the research questions as there exists no archival database with
   detailed information on ambidextrous SC strategies and dynamic
   capability. A total of 316 usable responses were received from managers
   working in the SC area. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural
   equation modeling were run on SPSS (version 16.0) and AMOS (version
   18.0) to test the hypotheses to answer research questions.
   Findings - Overall, the results of the study confirmed that a dynamic SC
   capability-building process is an antecedent of SC ambidexterity, and
   that SC ambidexterity is important to firms as it mitigate the negative
   impact of SC disruptions and enhance business performance. To take
   advantage of an ambidextrous SC, through minimizing the negative impact
   of SC disruptions and maximizing firm performance, firms should
   continually search for creative ways to satisfy new market needs and
   adapt to the fast changing business environment.
   Originality/value - This study applied a dynamic capability-building
   process and ambidexterity to SCM. From the resilient SC perspective, the
   study found that the ability to effectively utilize existing resources
   and create novel strategies for problem solving plays a critical role in
   addressing SC disruptions.}},

Title = {{Value chain supply procurement strategies in international construction
   Cases of foreign constructors in China}},
Journal = {{MANAGEMENT DECISION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{501-521}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Firms compete using a variety of strategies. Typically they
   aim to provide something different, to be better, or simply cheaper. In
   the construction industry, the performance characteristics, quality and
   cost of the final delivered project will be the outcome of the interplay
   of capabilities of all the firms involved in the project. Consequently,
   in order to improve competitiveness, firms must pay attention to not
   only their own competitive advantage but to those of the firms, both
   up-stream and down-stream, on whom they depend in delivering their
   projects. For foreign constructors in China, those competitive
   considerations will be informed by circumstances different from home.
   How then do foreign constructors adapt themselves to the problem of
   sourcing competitively when located within a China-based supply chain?
   The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study 60 foreign enterprises
   operating within the Chinese construction sector were investigated by
   using a comparative case study approach.
   Findings - Four generic procurement strategies were identified. First,
   firms adapt themselves in the search for optimal supply sources by
   replicating home-based suppliers, controlling local suppliers, or by
   remaining agile and non-aligned. Second, firms develop niche supply
   monopolies through market dominance, uniquely differentiated offerings,
   or by integration with down-stream providers. Third, firms find
   opportunities to bring in off-shore technology intensive procurements,
   where that technology is either protected, improved upon, or sold.
   Finally, firms also seek to transit to China as a procurement base in
   order to reduce local supply cost, service world-wide operations, or as
   part of a total strategy of China relocation.
   Originality/value - The identification of this rich range of procurement
   approaches will be of interest to internationalization strategists, as
   well as to industry practitioners looking to find appropriate business
   models for off-shore operations.}},

Title = {{Frequency-Tunable Miniaturized Strip Loop Antenna Fed by a Coplanar
   Strip}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{1000-1003}},
Abstract = {{A frequency-agile miniaturized uniplanar strip loop antenna fed by a
   coplanar strip (CPS) is proposed. It is for the first time that the
   half-wavelength resonant mode of CPS-fed strip loop antenna is exploited
   for frequency-agile operation. First, the matching method for a CPS-fed
   strip loop antenna to operate at its fundamental mode, i.e.,
   half-wavelength resonance, is discussed. Second, for reducing the
   antenna size, an inductor L-ter is used to change the boundary condition
   at the virtual-short point along the strip loop. For a given perimeter
   of the loop, increasing L-ter lowers its resonant frequency. The design
   concept is verified through a series of prototype antennas loaded with
   chip inductors of different values. Third, frequency agility is achieved
   by replacing the chip inductor by a tunable inductor, which, in this
   study, is realized by connecting an inductor of larger inductance in
   series with a varactor diode. A prototype antenna is also designed,
   fabricated, and tested. The simulated and measured results consistently
   show that the resonant frequency is continuously tunable between 2.0 and
   2.5 GHz (> 22.2\%) as the bias voltage is adjusted from 0 to 20 V. The
   proposed antenna has a simple uniplanar structure with a very compact
   footprint of 10 x 10 mm(2) (only lambda(0)/15 x lambda(0)/15 at 2.0
   GHz).}},

Abstract = {{In industries like Transportation, Aerospace and Defense or High-Tech,
   the effective development of complex systems implies mastering multiple
   disciplines and processes: project, people and data governance
   processes, requirements based and model based system engineering
   approaches, System Architecture Design with trade-off analysis,
   cross-disciplinary detailed design, integration, test, validation and
   verification methods. These processes are interrelated; managing
   complexity calls for tight collaboration between development
   stakeholders and demand very high data consistency between system
   compositional elements, at all levels. Organizations face significant
   challenges to maintaining coherency, consistency and relevance of this
   information across domains as well as capitalizing on it from one
   complex project to another; Failure to do so though is often resulting
   in costly reworks, product recalls, worse: attractiveness and
   competitiveness drops and jeopardized growth. In today's highly
   competitive, fast changing and demanding markets, saving investment
   time, resources and money for the creation of higher market appeal
   products is vital. This presentation will outline a vision for an open
   and integrated System Engineering platform, that leverages the richness
   and efficiency of online communities, the effective composition and
   reuse of multidisciplinarily assets and the value of virtual user
   experiences, to facilitate new smart E/E systems development.
   Architecture of Systems is therefore just a unified and homogenous
   framework that allows to see all these different architectural
   traditions as instances of a same and unique ``abstract{''} discipline.
   This system-oriented discipline clearly emerges nowadays from the
   convergence that one can presently observe at the level of the
   scientific and methodological foundations of many architectural
   practices such as: Enterprise Architecture that allows to design
   integrated enterprise information systems, Software Architecture which
   is at the basis of all software design processes, Systems Architecture
   that is key for designing efficiently complex industrial systems,
   resulting from software-hardware integration, Organization and Project
   Architecture which underlies agile development methods. Architecture of
   Systems is therefore just a unified and homogenous framework that allows

Abstract = {{Current network architectures are ill suited to meet today's enterprise
   and academic requirements. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new
   way to Design, Build and Operate Networks. It replaces static,
   inflexible and complex networks with networks that are agile, scalable
   and innovative. The main idea is to decouple the control and data
   planes, allowing the network to be programmatically controlled. A key
   element of SDN architectures is the controller. This logically
   centralized entity acts as a network operating system, providing
   applications with a uniform and centralized programming interface to the
   underlying network. But it also introduces new security challenges. The
   challenge of building robust firewalls is the main challenge for
   protection of OpenFlow networks. The main problem with traditional
   firewall is that Network Administrator cannot modify/extend the
   capabilities of traditional vendor-specific firewall. Network
   Administrator can only configure the firewall according to the
   specifications given by the firewall vendor. To solve these problems we
   developed stateful firewall application that runs over SDN controller to
   show that most of the firewall functionalities can be built on software,
   without the aid of a dedicated hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidically repositionable metallized plates have been recently
   introduced as a technique to realize frequency-agile bandpass filters
   with low insertion loss (IL) and wideband continuous frequency
   tunability. This paper utilizes a hybrid (circuit and electromagnetic
   simulation) model for time efficient simulations and introduces
   fourth-order bandpass filter designs for the first time to extend the
   applicability of the technique to higher order frequency-agile RF filter
   design. The paper introduces novel microfluidic channel and resonator
   configurations to demonstrate that the proposed filters can serve
   application specific footprint needs. By resorting to a selectively
   metallized plate approach, the reliability issue associated with
   synchronized movement of multiple metallized plates has been resolved.
   The filters are incorporated with micropumps to enable their automated
   control. Specifically, the concepts are demonstrated through design,
   fabrication, and testing of two fourth-order bandpass filters exhibiting
   different resonator arrangement layouts. The filters were measured to
   operate over similar to 2:1 (60\%) frequency tuning range (0.8 GHz -1.5
   GHz) with better than 4.5 dB IL, similar to 5\% constant fractional
   bandwidth (FBW), and >40 dB out of band rejection implying a good

Abstract = {{Integrating agile software methodologies can be fraught with risk for
   many software development organizations, but the potential rewards in
   terms of productivity, delivered functionality, and overall success rate
   are promising. Agile integration may be hard in certain organizational
   structures, but integrating security into such an approach can pose an
   even greater challenge. Ultimately, academia must do its part to
   introduce future computing professionals to these large areas of
   knowledge. In this paper, we consider the issues and problems of
   introducing secure agile software principles into undergraduate
   curriculum. We report observations, results, and pedagogic lessons
   learned from an empirical study as part of an undergraduate software
   engineering course. The conclusions and suggestions provide valuable
   insight for educators and practitioners alike since both communities
   deal often with how to best introduce agile and security to new

Title = {{Cross-factor analysis of software engineering practices versus
   practitioner demographics: An exploratory study in Turkey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{49-73}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Context: Understanding the types of software engineering practices and
   techniques used in the industry is important. There is a wide spectrum
   in terms of the types and maturity of software engineering practices
   conducted in each software team and company. Furthermore, it is
   important to understand the cross-factor relationship of software
   engineering practices and practitioner demographics including their
   companies and projects, e.g., is it the case that practitioners
   developing software for sectors such as military would utilize software
   size measurement approaches more, or use different software development
   methodologies, compared to practitioners developing software for other
   sectors?, and what kinds of practices are conducted by practitioners in
   small versus large companies?
   Objective: Our objective is to get an understanding into the
   cross-factor correlation of various software engineering practices
   versus practitioner demographics including their companies and projects
   (e.g., target industry, size and work experience). Such an understanding
   will enable us to identify patterns and pinpoint special issues which
   should be studied and addressed in the context of each specific
   demographic (e.g., small versus large companies). Thus, we decided to
   conduct an exploratory study in this area and collected real industrial
   data in the context of Turkey which has a vibrant software industry.
   Method: To achieve the above objective, we use the data from a recent
   Turkish-wide survey of software engineering practices which was
   systematically designed with 46 questions based on our past experience
   in the Canadian context and using the Software Engineering Body of
   Knowledge (SWEBOK). 202 practicing software engineers participated in
   the survey. We raise a set of 12 research questions about the
   cross-factor correlation of software engineering practices and
   practitioner demographics, and address them using statistical analysis.
   Results: The exploratory study results reveal important and interesting
   findings about cross-factor relationship of software engineering
   practices and practitioner demographics. Among some of the most
   interesting findings are the followings: (1) By analyzing the trends, we
   were first surprised to see that as a practitioner gets more years of
   work experience, against what one would expect, s/he experiences more
   challenges in Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phases and SE
   tasks; (2) Almost 55\% of participants measure software size; (3)
   Agile/lean development is used the least (16\%) by the participants
   working in the companies serving the military and defense sector; (4)
   Usage of waterfall is low among participants employed by small sized
   companies whereas Agile/lean development is relatively popular among
   this class of participants; and (5) As company size increases, usage of
   spiral development slightly increases, whereas usage of extreme
   programming practices decreases.
   Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study will be useful to
   software engineering professionals and researchers both in Turkey and
   world-wide by revealing the cross-factor relationship of software
   engineering practices versus practitioner demographics. The study raises
   several new research directions, e.g., (1) Why are not many
   practitioners using any size nor project estimation metrics and how
   these fundamental engineering approaches could be utilized more
   frequently?, (2) What are the best practices, success stories and
   challenging experiences in using SE tools?, and (3) Why is Agile lean
   development is not popular in the military and defense sector and how
   these approaches could be utilized more frequently. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{157-184}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Context: Combining software architecture and agile development has
   received significant attention in recent years. However, there exists no
   comprehensive overview of the state of research on the
   architecture-agility combination.
   Objective: This work aims to analyze the combination of architecture and
   agile methods for the purpose of exploration and analysis with respect
   to architecting activities and approaches, agile methods and practices,
   costs, benefits, challenges, factors, tools, and lessons learned
   concerning the combination.
   Method: A systematic mapping study (SMS) was conducted, covering the
   literature on the architecture-agility combination published between
   February 2001 and January 2014.
   Results: Fifty-four studies were finally included in this SMS. Some of
   the highlights: (1) a significant difference exists in the proportion of
   various architecting activities, agile methods, and agile practices
   employed in the combination. (2) none of the architecting approaches has
   been widely used in the combination. (3) there is a lack of description
   and analysis regarding the costs and failure stories of the combination.
   (4) twenty challenges, twenty-nine factors, and twenty-five lessons
   learned were identified.
   Conclusions: The results of this SMS help the software engineering
   community to reflect on the past thirteen years of research and practice
   on the architecture-agility combination with a number of implications.

Title = {{Towards better Scrum learning using learning styles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{242-253}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Considerable attention has been paid to teaching Scrum in software
   engineering education as an academic response to the software industry's
   demands. In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum
   concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering
   for students' individual learning characteristics. To address this
   issue, learning styles become effective to understand students'
   different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis
   claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the
   students' learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails
   to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of
   software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing
   hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder-Silverman
   Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we
   focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our
   approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software
   engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided
   students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting
   students' learning style. Test results corroborate that students'
   outcomes improved when receiving the strategy that match their learning
   styles. Our data highlight opportunities for improving software
   engineering education by considering the students' learning preferences.

Title = {{Embracing supply chain agility: an investigation in the electronics
   industry}},
Journal = {{SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{140-156}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to identify the antecedents of firm's supply
   chain agility (SC agility) and how SC agility impacts on firm's
   performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on a comprehensive literature
   review, a conceptual model was proposed, in which the interrelated
   hypotheses were tested by structural equation modelling methodology
   using a dataset collected from 266 Chinese electronics firms.
   Findings - Initially, it was found that SC integration and external
   learning positively influenced SC agility. Second, the results indicated
   that firm's performance is positively impacted by SC agility. Moreover,
   SC agility also fully mediated the effect of SC integration on firm's
   performance and the effect of external learning on firm's performance.
   Research limitations/implications - The generalizability of this
   research sample might be the major limitation of this study. Therefore,
   future research can adopt other industry sectors samples, such as
   automobile manufacturing, or other country samples to validate the
   research model.
   Practical implications - This research outlines strategies for better
   preparedness to achieve SCs to be agile which is a core competency of
   electronic firms in emerging market. Findings reveal that the external
   coordination practices - external learning and SC integration - are
   important factors of SC agility. In addition, the findings contribute to
   understanding the important role of SC agility in improving firm's
   performance.
   Originality/value - This research examines the impact of two antecedents
   (i.e. SC integration and external learning) on SC agility and is the
   first empirical research to analyze the mediation effect of SC agility
   on the relationship between SC integration and firm performance and the
   relationship between external learning and firm performance.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of Agile Software Development in large companies is a
   recent phenomenon of great interest both for researchers and
   practitioners. Although intra-team interaction is well supported by
   established agile practices, the critical interaction between the agile
   team and other parts of the organization is still unexplored in
   literature. Such interactions slow down the development, hindering the
   achievement of business goals based on speed: short time to market,
   quick replication of products of a product-line, and reaction time for
   product evolution. We have employed a two-year long multiple-case
   case-study, collecting data through interviews and a survey in three
   large companies developing embedded software. Through a combination of
   qualitative and quantitative analysis, we have found strong evidence
   that interaction challenges between the development team and other
   groups in the organization hinder speed and are widespread in the
   organizations. This paper also identifies current practices in use at
   the studied companies and provides detailed guidelines for novel
   solutions in the investigated domain. Such practices are called
   boundary-spanning activities in information system research and
   coordination theory. We present a comparison between large embedded
   software companies employing agile and developing a line of products
   based on reused assets and agile companies developing pure software. We
   highlight specific contextual factors and areas where novel spanning
   activities are needed for mitigating the interaction challenges
   hindering speed. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of a tunable microwave filtering device with reconfigurable
   bandpass-filter (BPF) and bandstop-filter (BSF) operational modes is
   reported. It consists of series-cascaded BPF/BSF stages which are formed

   impedance inverters. Each BPF/BSF stage results in two transmission
   zeros (TZs) that are generated at the natural frequencies of the
   constituent resonators, whose spectral locations can be reconfigured by
   tuning the resonating elements. Thus, multi-TZ BPF/BSF responses can be
   synthesized in the overall circuit which features fully-controllable
   performances by means of TZ reallocation. The coupling-matrix
   representation of the proposed frequency-agile BPF/BSF scheme is
   demonstrated. Moreover, an S-band two-stage prototype based on
   frequency-reconfigurable evanescent-mode cavity resonators is fabricated

Abstract = {{NFV and SDN are nowadays seen as a solid opportunity by telecom
   operators to reduce costs while at the same time providing new and
   better services. Recently, the Unify project proposed a multi-layered
   architecture that, leveraging different levels of abstraction, can
   orchestrate and deploy generic network services on the physical
   infrastructure of the telecom operator. In this paper, we exploit such
   an architecture to deliver end-to-end generic services in presence of
   multiple concurring players (e.g. network operator, end-users),
   leveraging a new simple data model. Particularly, we propose a
   description-based approach allowing the deployment agile,
   implementation-independent and high-level network services over a
   distributed set of resources. The resulting data model can abstract
   generic services, including both middlebox-based (e.g., firewalls, NATs,
   etc.) and traditional LAN-based ones (e.g., a BitTorrent client).
   Finally, two distinct prototypes, originated by different design
   principles, are implemented in order to validate our proposal with the
   aim of demonstrating the adaptability of our approach to different
   contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The values and principles described in the Agile Manifesto support the
   optimization of the development process. In this article, the current
   operation is analyzed in Agile Product Development Processes. Both, the
   cooperation in the project team and the understanding of the roles and
   tasks will be analyzed. The results are set in relation to the best
   practices of Agile Methodologies. A quantitative questionnaire related
   to best practices in Agile Product Development was developed. The study
   was carried out with 175 interdisciplinary participants from the IT
   industry. For the evaluation of the results, 93 participants were
   included who have expertise in the subject area Agile Methodologies. On
   one hand, it is shown that the collaborative development of
   product-related ideas brings benefits. On the other hand, it is
   investigated which effect a good understanding of the product has on

Abstract = {{With the development of mobile telecommunication technology, mobile
   phones have become a necessary tool in daily life and provided us many
   conveniences. Meanwhile, the huge number of cell phones constitute a
   potential high performance data processing system, called mobile cloud
   computing, to strengthen capacity for individual devices. Many
   researchers have studied about the architectures and scheduling
   algorithms of mobile cloud computing. However, little work has been
   performed about how to schedule mobile application tasks in data centers
   to extend battery life for mobile terminals. To address this issue, we
   investigate agent models, mobile energy consumption models and data
   transmission models under different connection environments. Based on
   which, we propose a novel terminal energy efficient scheduling method
   (AGILE for short). AGILE compares energy consumption in cloud execution
   and mobile execution according to the actual wireless environment, then
   makes energy-efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted to
   evaluate the performance of the AGILE under different wireless channels,
   and the performance impact on different parameters are studied. The
   experimental results indicate that the proposed method can save mobile
   devices' energy effectively. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{787-807}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article investigates software process diversity, defined as the
   project condition arising out of the simultaneous use of multiple
   software development process frameworks within a single project.
   Software process diversity is conceptualized as the response of a
   project team to such contingencies as requirements volatility, design
   and technological novelty, customer involvement, and the level of
   organizational process compliance enforced on the project. Moreover, we
   conceptualize that the degree of fit (or match) between a project's
   software process diversity and the level of process compliance enforced
   on the project impacts overall project performance. This
   conceptualization was empirically tested by utilizing data collected
   from 410 large commercial software projects of a multinational firm. The
   results show that higher levels of requirements volatility, design and
   technological novelty, and customer involvement increased software
   process diversity within a project. However, software process diversity
   decreased relative to increases in the level of process compliance
   enforced on the project. A higher degree of fit between the process
   diversity and process compliance of a project, rather than the effects
   of those variables independently, was found to be significantly
   associated with a higher level of project performance, as measured in
   terms of project productivity and software quality. These results
   indicate that increasing software process diversity in response to
   project-level contingencies improves project performance only when there
   is a concomitant increase in organizational process compliance efforts.
   The implications of these results for research are discussed and
   prescriptive guidelines derived to manage the fit between process
   diversity and process compliance for improving software project
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{In software-defined radio and cognitive radio enabled future 5G mobile
   networks, and SDN-NFV system will enable high flexibility in

   design the system to identify the optimal mechanism that maximizes both

   optimize the service chaining according to the user requirements and

   optimization framework that jointly controls and optimizes the resource
   allocation in networking and service provisioning. By modeling the
   network and services together and developing optimization techniques
   that jointly examine both, this framework benefits the overall system
   performance in various scenarios of traffic steering, VM selection,

Abstract = {{Filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) is a candidate modulation scheme for 5G
   cellular mobile broad-band networks. A specific domain where FBMC offers
   a clear advantage over other multicarrier solutions is the efficient
   occupancy of underutilized and fragmented spectrum. This is due to the
   rich spectral containment of the FBMC technology, which guarantees
   superior interference protection to the primary coexisting
   transmissions. These features of FBMC could play an important role in
   the economic delivery of 5G services in licensed and unlicensed bands.
   This article focuses on the public safety domain where existing
   professional mobile radio (PMR) users plan to add broadband services at
   the 400 MHz band, aiming to occupy the spectral holes left by current
   narrowband transmissions. In this respect an agile SDR broadband
   downlink FBMC system, aimed at exploiting unused licensed PMR spectrum,
   was developed and experimentally validated. The FBMC frame structure
   shared key similarities with the LTE specification. Two different SDR
   design methodologies were used to build the real-time baseband
   prototype. The level of interference protection offered by a broadband
   FBMC system to a coexisting primary narrowband PMR transmission was
   practically demonstrated and compared to that of an equivalent LTE
   system. This was made feasible by evaluating the performance of a PMR
   terminal under different mobile channels and FBMC waveform
   configurations. The applicability of this work to other 5G spectrum
   cohabitation scenarios is discussed. Finally, the article highlights the
   need to extend the SDR design paradigm in order to tackle the challenges
   of real-time baseband processing in 5G broadband cellular systems.}},

Abstract = {{In today's global environment supply chains should be agile and
   responsive. Ideally, suppliers would like to know the order quantities
   with enough lead-time to set up the production process and schedule for
   delivery. However, retailers cannot predict demand accurately and thus
   both suppliers and retailers may incur significant losses due to
   under-stocking and/or over-stocking. To attenuate this effect, one of
   the viable practices is that suppliers impose minimum Order Quantity
   Commitments (OQC) for regular orders and penalties for reduced orders,
   while providing retailers with expedited-delivery options at premium
   costs if needs arise. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to
   assist in developing inventory management policies to optimize the
   expected profit. Our model considers a two-period setting where
   retailers place orders according to pre-sale forecasts but then have the
   opportunity to update their orders just prior to the season according to
   the most recent forecasts and the current inventory level. Utilizing the
   newsvendor model and dynamic programming methods, we obtain the optimal
   ordering and replenishing policies that maximize the expected profits of
   retailers. We then analyze the impacts of these flexible terms on the
   performance of both the retailer and the supplier. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   ``express path,{''} (ExP) an instant wavelength path on demand, which
   enables certain flows following the ExP with no packet contention,
   whereas ordinary OPS packets are switched with a deflection routing
   algorithm and buffering for contention resolution. This architecture can
   support OCS for large and reliability-sensitive data transferring and
   OPS for latency-sensitive applications. The performance of the network
   is investigated via numerical simulations of top-of-rack switch
   (ToR)-to-ToR traffic in an N-dimensional (up to 4096 node) torus
   topology. We have made the following observations: 1) torus topology
   results in high throughput and can be scaled out by increasing the
   dimension; 2) contention resolution between OPS and agile OCS is needed

Abstract = {{Software development is a complex socio-technical activity, with the
   result that software development organisations need to establish and

   regarding the effectiveness of various software development approaches,
   no single approach is perfectly suited to all settings and no setting is
   unchanging. The capability to adapt the software process is therefore
   essential to sustaining an optimal software process. We designed an
   exploratory study to concurrently examine software process adaptive
   capability and organisational performance in 15 software development
   organisations, finding that companies with greater software process
   adaptive capability are shown to also experience greater business
   success. While our exploratory study of the complex relationship between
   these phenomena is limited in some respects, the findings indicate that
   software process adaptive capability may be worthy of further
   integration into software process engineering techniques. Software
   process adaptive capability may be an important organisational strength

Abstract = {{In this paper, we show a second-order (four-resonator) absorptive

   design. Analytic design equations are provided so that a higher-order

   shown that the second-order filter topology exhibits a better frequency

Abstract = {{Background: The software development industry has been adopting agile
   methods instead of traditional software development methods because they
   are more flexible and can bring benefits such as handling requirements
   changes, productivity gains and business alignment. Objective: This
   study seeks to evaluate, synthesize, and present aspects of research on
   agile methods tailoring including the method tailoring approaches
   adopted and the criteria used for agile practice selection. Method: The
   method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies
   published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been
   identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches. These
   studies have been identified as case studies regarding the empirical
   research, as solution proposals regarding the research type, and as
   evaluation studies regarding the research validation type. Most of the
   papers used method engineering to implement tailoring and were not
   specific to any agile method on their scope. Conclusion: Most of agile
   methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were
   implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated
   their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for
   tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main
   criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables. (c)

Abstract = {{Inspired by the aerial maneuvering ability of lizards, we present the
   design and control of MSU (Michigan State University) tailbot-a
   miniature-tailed jumping robot. The robot can not only wheel on the
   ground, but also jump up to overcome obstacles. Moreover, once leaping
   into the air, it can control its body angle using an active tail to
   dynamically maneuver in midair for safe landings. We derive the midair
   dynamics equation and design controllers, such as a sliding mode
   controller, to stabilize the body at desired angles. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first miniature (maximum size 7.5 cm) and
   lightweight (26.5 g) robot that can wheel on the ground, jump to
   overcome obstacles, and maneuver in midair. Furthermore, tailbot is
   equipped with on-board energy, sensing, control, and wireless
   communication capabilities, enabling tetherless or autonomous
   operations. The robot in this paper exemplifies the integration of
   mechanical design, embedded system, and advanced control methods that
   will inspire the next-generation agile robots mimicking their biological
   counterparts. Moreover, it can serve as mobile sensor platforms for
   wireless sensor networks with many field applications.}},

Abstract = {{Software development teams in large scale offshore enterprise
   development programmes are often under intense pressure to deliver high
   quality software within challenging time contraints. Project failures
   can attract adverse publicity and damage corporate reputations. Agile
   methods have been advocated to reduce project risks, improving both
   productivity and product quality. This article uses practitioner
   descriptions of agile method tailoring to explore large scale offshore
   enterprise development programmes with a focus on product owner role
   tailoring, where the product owner identifies and prioritises customer
   requirements. In globalised projects, the product owner must reconcile
   competing business interests, whilst generating and then prioritising
   large numbers of requirements for numerous development teams. The study
   comprises eight international companies, based in London, Bangalore and
   Delhi. Interviews with 46 practitioners were conducted between February
   2010 and May 2012. Grounded theory was used to identify that product
   owners form into teams. The main contribution of this research is to
   describe the nine product owner team functions identified: groom,
   prioritiser, release master, technical architect, governor,
   communicator, traveller, intermediary and risk assessor. These product
   owner functions arbitrate between conflicting customer requirements,
   approve release schedules, disseminate architectural design decisions,
   provide technical governance and propogate information across teams. The
   functions identified in this research are mapped to a scrum of scrums
   process, and a taxonomy of the functions shows how focusing on either
   decision-making or information dissemination in each helps to tailor
   agile methods to large scale offshore enterprise development programmes.}},

Abstract = {{The interest in lean product development in general and the Kanban
   approach in particular has increased over the years. However,
   practitioners, in the software development field, have significant
   challenges in implementing the Kanban approach as it lacks a clear
   definition of its principles, practices, techniques and tools. This
   study aims to provide insight into the Kanban approach and its elements
   (concepts, principles, practices, techniques, and tools) that have been
   empirically reported by scholars and practitioners. This insight is
   produced by using the systematic review method to analyze the available
   literature. A total of 37 primary studies were selected from more than
   3,000 unique studies. Our findings show that the primary studies have
   considered and reported 20 different elements as part of the Kanban
   approach based upon considerations of being an agile approach or a lean
   principle; these elements have realized great benefits and improvements
   to the software development teams. These benefits along with the
   challenges have been reported in this study. Due to the variety of
   organization types, contexts, and project sizes reported in the primary
   studies, it is expected that the results in this study would help in
   establishing knowledge on what are the different elements of the Kanban

Abstract = {{Quality control, failure analysis and improvement are central elements
   in manufacturing. Total Quality Management (TQM) provides several
   quality oriented tools and techniques which, in the event of things, are
   not always applicable. The increased use of Information Technology (IT)
   in manufacturing means increased data availability and improved
   potential for knowledge extraction. Exploiting this knowledge requires
   data storage and processing facilities with demanding, time consuming
   sessions for interpretation. Without suitable tools and techniques,
   knowledge remains hidden in databases. This paper presents a method to
   help identify root causes of nonconformities (NCs) using a pattern
   identification approach. Hereby, a general framework, Knowledge
   Discovery in Databases (KDD), is adapted. This adaptation involves
   incorporating an economic concentration measure, the
   Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), as the data mining algorithm. After
   presenting the theoretical background, a new methodology is proposed.
   The suggested approach can be regarded as a quality tool to help make
   root cause identification of failures simpler and more agile. A case
   study from the automotive industry is examined using this tool. Results
   are obtained and presented in the form of matrix based patterns. They

   In simple terms, a supply chain can be visualised as a series of

   increasingly differentiated as it travels downstream. The manufacturer
   is responsible for all processing up to the point of purchase, whereas
   the buyer (a value-added reseller) is responsible for further processing
   up to the end of product completion. Product demand becomes more and
   more uncertain with each downstream stage resulting in ever larger
   errors in matching demand with supply. Our paper proposes an approach

Abstract = {{A frequency-agile, efficient, circularly polarized (CP), near-field
   resonant parasitic (NFRP) antenna is presented. It consists of two
   orthogonal capacitively loaded loops (CLLs) with similar configurations
   placed vertically with respect to a finite ground disc and serve as the
   NFRP elements. They are placed in the near field of two monopoles fed
   from a single coax feedline. A pair of varactor diodes is incorporated
   into the NFRP elements to achieve its frequency-agile behavior. The NFRP
   elements produce nearly complete matching at frequencies much lower than
   the fundamental modes of the monopoles without any matching circuit.
   Frequency tunability is demonstrated over a wide effective impedance
   bandwidth and the antenna is characterized as having good axial ratio
   (AR) and high radiation efficiency. A proof-of-concept experiment
   produced reasonable agreement with the simulation studies. The measured
   results demonstrate that the frequency-agile prototype produced a 3.92\%
   fractional 3-dB AR bandwidth, which is more than four times larger than
   the 0.84\% value of the original fixed-capacitor passive system.

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{DNS is often abused by Internet criminals in order to provide flexible
   and resilient hosting of malicious content and reliable communication
   within their network architecture.The majority of detection methods
   targeting malicious DNS traffic are data-driven, most commonly having
   machine learning algorithms at their core. These methods require
   accurate ground truth of both malicious and benign DNS traffic for model
   training as well as for the performance evaluation. This paper
   elaborates on the problem of obtaining such a ground truth and evaluates
   practices employed by contemporary detection methods. Building upon the
   evaluation results, we propose a novel semi-manual labeling practice
   targeting agile DNS mappings, i.e. DNS queries that are used to reach a
   potentially malicious server characterized by fast changing domain names
   or/and IP addresses.The proposed approach is developed with the purpose
   of obtaining ground truth by incorporating the operator's insight in
   efficient and effective manner. We evaluate the proposed approach on a
   case study based on DNS traffic from an ISP network by comparing it with
   the popular labeling practices that rely on domain name and IP
   blacklists and whitelisting of popular domains. The evaluation indicates
   challenges and limitations of relying on existing labeling practices and
   shows a clear advantage of using the proposed approach in discovering a
   more complete set of potentially malicious domains and IF addresses.
   Furthermore, the novel approach attains time-efficient labeling with
   limited operator's involvement, thus is promising in view of the
   adoption in operational ISP networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Cognitive radios (CRs) have been proposed to improve spectrum
   utilization by enabling opportunistic and dynamic spectrum access for
   unlicensed users. To enable efficient CR communications, a reliable
   control channel (CC) for exchanging control information is needed. In
   this paper, a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)-based underlay CC
   design for distributed coordination in CR networks (CRNs) is proposed.
   The proposed design provides immunity to licensed primary radio (PR)
   interference (reliable communication), low transmission power (PR users'
   protection) and predefined-required transmission rate and range (network
   connectivity). The Proposed design ensures that both narrow-band data
   and wide-band control transmissions can be simultaneously proceeded
   while protecting the performance of PR users. To ensure reliable CR
   control communications, a closed-form expression is derived for the
   minimum required transmission power for control packet transmissions
   such that required transmission range and rate are achieved. Based on
   the derived expression, the maximum allowable transmission power for CR
   data transmissions is computed such that an enforced power mask
   constrain over the PR channels is not violated. Simulation results
   indicate that the proposed CC design enables efficient CR communications

Abstract = {{Context: Several industries developing products on a large-scale are
   facing major challenges as their products are becoming more and more
   software-intensive. Whereas software was once considered a detail to be
   bundled, it has since become an intricate and interdependent part of
   most products. The advancement of software increases the uncertainty and
   the interdependencies between development tasks and artifacts. A key
   success factor is good requirements engineering (RE), and in particular,
   the challenges of effectively and efficiently coordinating and
   communicating requirements.
   Objective: In this work we present a lightweight RE framework and
   demonstrate and evaluate its industrial applicability in response to the
   needs of a Swedish automotive company for improving specific problems in
   inter-departmental requirements coordination and communication in
   large-scale development of software-intensive systems.
   Method: A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to
   develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our
   industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car
   project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations
   when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in
   a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews.
   Results: The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed
   that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful
   and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and
   communicating requirements identified at the case company. However,
   other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and
   competences in the early development phases, were identified when using
   the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken.
   Conclusion: Overall, the experience from using the framework and the
   positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible
   framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems
   related to coordination and communication of requirements. Based on the
   promising results, our industrial partner has decided upon further
   validations of the framework in a large-scale pilot program. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Context: Agile enterprise architecture artefacts are initially
   architected at the high-level and the details of those artefacts
   iteratively evolve in small project increments. There is a need to model
   agile enterprise architecture artefacts both at the high and low
   detailed level for a particular context. ArchiMate is relatively a new
   high-level architecture modelling standard. There is a growing interest
   amongst organisations in applying ArchiMate for high-level agile
   enterprise architecture modelling. However, organisations are unsure how
   to effectively apply ArchiMate at high-level and integrate it with their
   existing low detailed level modelling standards in practice for
   supporting end-to-end agile enterprise architecture modelling.
   Objective: This paper evaluates the applicability and integration of
   high-level ArchiMate modelling standard with the existing low-level
   modelling standards such as BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation),
   UML (Unified Modelling Language), FAML (FAME {[}Framework for
   Agent-Oriented Method Engineering] Language), SoaML (Service Oriented
   Architecture Modelling Language), and BMM (Business Motivation Model).
   Method: A qualitative questionnaire-based evaluation criteria has been
   developed based on the well-known and comprehensive The Open Group
   Architecture Framework (TOGAF). The evaluation criteria has been applied
   to evaluate the applicability and integration of the selected six
   modelling standards from the business, application, infrastructure and
   extension perspectives.
   Results: Each modelling standard is different in scope. A single
   modelling standard usually does not provide the kind of support required
   by the agile enterprise architecture modelling. Based on the review
   results, a hybrid enterprise architecture modelling approach is
   proposed. This paper demonstrates the application of the proposed hybrid
   approach with the help of an agile enterprise architecture modelling
   case study.
   Conclusion: It is concluded that the ArchiMate does not replace the
   existing low-level modelling standards, rather it can be used in
   conjunction with low-level modelling standards. This calls for the
   adoption of hybrid and integrated approach for agile enterprise
   architecture modelling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Claims about the use of software engineering practices in science: A
   systematic literature review}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{207-219}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context: Scientists have become increasingly reliant on software in
   order to perform research that is too time-intensive, expensive, or
   dangerous to perform physically. Because the results produced by the
   software drive important decisions, the software must be correct and
   developed efficiently. Various software engineering practices have been
   shown to increase correctness and efficiency in the development of
   traditional software. It is unclear whether these observations will hold
   in a scientific context.
   Objective: This paper evaluates claims from software engineers and
   scientific software developers about 12 different software engineering
   practices and their use in developing scientific software.
   Method: We performed a systematic literature review examining claims
   about how scientists develop software. Of the 189 papers originally
   identified, 43 are included in the literature review. These 43 papers
   contain 33 different claims about 12 software engineering practices.
   Results: The majority of the claims indicated that software engineering
   practices are useful for scientific software development. Every claim
   was supported by evidence (i.e. personal experience, interview/survey,
   or case study) with slightly over half supported by multiple forms of
   evidence. For those claims supported by only one type of evidence,
   interviews/surveys were the most common. The claims that received the
   most support were: ``The effectiveness of the testing practices
   currently used by scientific software developers is limited{''} and
   ``Version control software is necessary for research groups with more
   than one developer.{''} Additionally, many scientific software
   developers have unconsciously adopted an agile-like development
   methodology.
   Conclusion: Use of software engineering practices could increase the
   correctness of scientific software and the efficiency of its
   development. While there is still potential for increased use of these
   practices, scientific software developers have begun to embrace software
   engineering practices to improve their software. Additionally, software
   engineering practices still need to be tailored to better fit the needs
   of scientific software development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Context: A known problem in large software companies is to balance the
   prioritization of short-term with long-term feature delivery speed.
   Specifically, Architecture Technical Debt is regarded as sub-optimal
   architectural solutions taken to deliver fast that might hinder future
   feature development, which, in turn, would hinder agility.
   Objective: This paper aims at improving software management by shedding
   light on the current factors responsible for the accumulation of
   Architectural Technical Debt and to understand how it evolves over time.
   Method: We conducted an exploratory multiple-case embedded case study in
   7 sites at 5 large companies. We evaluated the results with additional
   cross-company interviews and an in-depth, company-specific case study in
   which we initially evaluate factors and models.
   Results: We compiled a taxonomy of the factors and their influence in
   the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt, and we provide two
   qualitative models of how the debt is accumulated and refactored over
   time in the studied companies. We also list a set of exploratory
   propositions on possible refactoring strategies that can be useful as
   insights for practitioners and as hypotheses for further research.
   Conclusion: Several factors cause constant and unavoidable accumulation
   of Architecture Technical Debt, which leads to development crises.
   Refactorings are often overlooked in prioritization and they are often
   triggered by development crises, in a reactive fashion. Some of the
   factors are manageable, while others are external to the companies. ATD
   needs to be made visible, in order to postpone the crises according to
   the strategic goals of the companies. There is a need for practices and
   automated tools to proactively manage ATD. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Context: The planning, estimation and controlling mechanisms of agile
   process models rely significantly on a fixed set of tasks being
   established for each sprint. These tasks are created as refinements of
   product backlog items at the beginning of each sprint. However, a
   project team's understanding of the backlog items' business implications
   and dependencies may often not be deep enough to identify all necessary
   tasks this early, so in addition to the tasks defined in the beginning
   of the sprint, more necessary tasks might be discovered as the sprint
   progresses, making any attempt at progress estimation or risk management
   difficult.
   Objective: We strive to enable software teams to achieve a deeper
   understanding of product backlog items, which should help them to
   identify a sprint's tasks more reliably and comprehensively, and avoid
   discovering the need for extra tasks during sprint execution.
   Method: We introduced a project team in a medium-sized software
   development company to the Interaction Room method, which encourages
   interdisciplinary communication about key system design aspects among
   all stakeholders. We observed the team's conduct in the sprint planning
   meetings, and tracked early- vs. late-identified tasks across several
   sprints.
   Results: Before the introduction of our method, the team used to
   discover on average 26\% of a sprint's tasks not at the beginning of the
   sprint, but later during the course of the sprint. Using the Interaction
   Room in two separate projects, this ratio dropped to an average of 5\%
   late-discovered tasks.
   Conclusion: Our observations from these projects suggest that increased
   communication among all stakeholders of a project leads to a more
   reliable identification of the tasks to be performed in a sprint, and
   that an Interaction Room can provide appropriate guidance to conduct
   this team communication in a focused and pragmatic way. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify challenges, lessons learned and best practices
   for service-oriented clinical decision support, based on the results of
   the Clinical Decision Support Consortium, a multi-site study which
   developed, implemented and evaluated clinical decision support services
   in a diverse range of electronic health records.
   Methods: Ethnographic investigation using the rapid assessment process,
   a procedure for agile qualitative data collection and analysis,
   including clinical observation, system demonstrations and analysis and
   91 interviews.
   Results: We identified challenges and lessons learned in eight
   dimensions: (1) hardware and software computing infrastructure, (2)
   clinical content, (3) human-computer interface, (4) people, (5) workflow
   and communication, (6) internal organizational policies, procedures,
   environment and culture, (7) external rules, regulations, and pressures
   and (8) system measurement and monitoring. Key challenges included
   performance issues (particularly related to data retrieval), differences
   in terminologies used across sites, workflow variability and the need
   for a legal framework.
   Discussion: Based on the challenges and lessons learned, we identified
   eight best practices for developers and implementers of service-oriented
   clinical decision support: (1) optimize performance, or make
   asynchronous calls, (2) be liberal in what you accept (particularly for
   terminology), (3) foster clinical transparency, (4) develop a legal
   framework, (5) support a flexible front-end, (6) dedicate human
   resources, (7) support peer-to-peer communication, (8) improve
   standards.
   Conclusion: The Clinical Decision Support Consortium successfully
   developed a clinical decision support service and implemented it in four
   different electronic health records and four diverse clinical sites;
   however, the process was arduous. The lessons identified by the
   Consortium may be useful for other developers and implementers of
   clinical decision support services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{32-49}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Requirements elicitation is one of the most important and challenging
   activities in software development projects. A variety of challenges
   related to requirements elicitation are reported in the literature, of
   which the lack of proper communication and knowledge transfer between
   software stakeholders are among the most important. Communication and
   knowledge transfer are becoming even bigger challenges with the current
   increase in globally distributed software development projects due to
   the temporal, geographic, and sociocultural diversity among software
   stakeholders. In this study, we propose a new approach to requirements
   elicitation, which employs online serious games for gathering
   requirements from distributed software stakeholders. The feasibility and
   effectiveness of the proposed approach were evaluated in an empirical
   study with encouraging results. These results especially reveal that our
   suggested approach enables less-experienced individuals to identify a
   higher number of requirements. Our results also reveal that for the
   majority of subjects, especially individuals with less technical
   experience, this approach was a pleasant and easy way of participating
   in requirements elicitation. Based on these results we suggest that
   using online serious games not only enhances innovation and creativity
   among end-users but also facilitates collaboration and communication
   among software stakeholders. Implications for both research and practice
   are considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Companies thereby face the challenge of coordinating individual aspects

   company can improve the mechanisms of coordination they need to be
   understood first. With REST-bench we aim at providing an assessment tool
   that illustrates the coordination in software development projects and
   identify concrete improvement opportunities. We have developed
   REST-bench on the sound fundamentals of a taxonomy on REST alignment
   methods and validated the method in five case studies. Following the
   principles of technical action research, we collaborated with five
   companies, applying REST-bench and iteratively improving the method
   based on the lessons we learned. We applied REST-bench both in Agile and
   plan-driven environments, in projects lasting from weeks to years, and
   staffed as large as 1000 employees. The improvement opportunities we

Abstract = {{Combinations of two metamaterial-inspired electrically small antennas
   are investigated numerically to achieve high directivity and enhanced

   antennas, one active and one passive, are arranged in an end-fire array
   configuration. The elements are designed to optimise the out-of-phase
   current distribution of the parasitic element to achieve enhanced
   directivity performance characteristics, including a peak gain >4.5 dB,
   front-to-back ratio >15 dB, and radiation efficiency >74\% over a 3.73
   MHz frequency range centred at 312.9 MHz when the separation distance
   between the elements is approximate to 0.04(res) and the total
   electrical size of the array is ka = 0.43. By simply increasing the
   width of both EAD parasitic elements, the array's end-fire
   characteristics are transformed into a configuration that has more than
   a six times increase of the impedance bandwidth. A frequency-agile
   version of the array is obtained by incorporating a varactor between the

Abstract = {{Outsourcing is a strategic option which complements IT services provided
   internally in organizations. The maturity model for IT service
   outsourcing (henceforth MM-2GES) is a new holistic maturity model based
   on standards ISO/IEC 20000 and ISO/IEC 38500, and the frameworks and

   outsourcing. MM-2GES allows independent validation, practical
   application, and an effective transition to a model of good governance
   and management of outsourced IT services.
   Cloud computing is a new model for provisioning and consuming IT
   services on a need and pay-per-use basis. This model allows the IT
   systems to be more agile and flexible. The external provision of
   cloud-based services as part of Cloud computing appears as an evolution
   of traditional outsourcing, due to the emerging technologies related to
   the provision of IT services. As a result of technological developments,
   traditional outsourcing and external provision of cloud-based services,
   share common characteristics, but there are also some differences.
   This paper adapts MM-2GES to external provision of cloud-based services,
   from the point of view of the customer. This way, the applicability of
   the model can be implemented in organizations that have both models
   traditional IT outsourcing and cloud-based services provided externally,

Abstract = {{At present, most of the passive radar system researches utilize FM
   radios, TV broadcasts, navigation satellites, etc. as illuminators. The
   transmitted signals are not specifically designed radar waveforms. In
   this work, the frequency agile, phased array air surveillance radar
   (ASR) is used as the illuminator of opportunity to detect the weak
   target. The phased array technology can help realize beam agility to
   track targets from different aspects simultaneously. The frequency
   agility technology is widely employed in radar system design to increase
   the ability of anti-jamming and increase the detection probability.
   While the frequency bandwidth of radar signals is usually wide and the
   range resolution is high, the range cell migration effect is obvious
   during the long time integration of non-cooperative bistatic radar. In
   this context, coherent integration methods are not applicable. In this
   work, a parametric non-coherent integration algorithm based on task
   de-interweaving is proposed. Numerical experiments verify that this is
   effective in weak target detection.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing product variety, shorter product life cycles, and unknown
   future demands for each product type are key challenges of manufacturing
   companies. This paper describes the concept of matrix-structured
   manufacturing systems (MMS) which aims at providing high operational
   flexibility and scalability. The main goal of MMS is to eliminate a
   constant cycle time by providing redundant work stations for same
   operations as well as a flexible product routing. This enables to avoid
   starving and blocking and to achieve high system utilization while
   producing multiple product types with unknown demands and high volumes.
   The paper explains the main principles, elements, and control strategies
   of MMS and presents a simulation approach for the evaluation of MMS
   configurations. A case study shows the application of the simulation
   approach and how it can be used in the planning of MMS. The results
   reveal that a MMS configuration can lead to better utilizations of the
   exemplary manufacturing system in comparison to a sequential assembly

Pages = {{775-786}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the ``power of the crowd{''} has been repeatedly
   demonstrated and various Internet platforms have been used to support
   applications of collaborative intelligence in tasks ranging from open
   innovation to image analysis. However, crowdsourcing applications in the
   fields of design research and creative innovation have been much slower
   to emerge. So, although there have been reports of systems and
   researchers using Internet crowdsourcing to carry out generative design,
   there are still many gaps in knowledge about the capability and
   limitations of the technology. Indeed the process models developed to
   support traditional commercial design (e.g. Pugh's Total Design, Agile,
   Double-Diamond etc.) have yet to be established for Crowdsourced Design
   (cDesign). As a contribution to the development of such a general model
   this paper proposes a cDesign framework to support the creation of
   crowdsourced design activities. Within the cDesign framework the
   effective evaluation of design quality is identified as a key component
   that not only enables the leveraging of a large, virtual workforce's
   creative activities but is also fundamental to almost all iterative
   optimisation processes. This paper reports an experimental investigation
   into two different Crowdsourced design evaluation approaches; free
   evaluation and `Crowdsourced Design Evaluation Criteria' (cDEC). The
   results are benchmarked against a `manual' evaluation carried out by a
   panel of experienced designers. The results suggest that the cDEC
   approach produces design rankings that correlate strongly with the
   judgements of an ``expert panel{''}. The paper concludes that cDEC
   assessment methodology demonstrates how Crowdsourcing can be effectively
   used to evaluate, as well as generate, new design solutions. (C) 2015

Pages = {{42-51}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Societies are shifting towards more complex structures and agile
   networks through spatial transformation. That shift affects the ways in
   which citizens interact with and within their physical and virtual
   surroundings. The interactions define purposes for the modern hybrid
   spaces, depending on individual demands in relation to space and time.
   As facilities per se are becoming less relevant, spatial concepts and
   service that support, attract, and engage modern individuals must be
   invented. The capabilities of user-orientated processes are important in
   terms of connectivity, co-creation, and communication, involvement in
   change, and control as well as governance. This article explores the
   potential scaling in diverse spatial transformations and summarizes the
   lessons learned from managing a campus as a small city to managing a
   larger-scale urban area. The study uses a case study methodology: the
   data was collected through interviews and document analysis. The
   framework of five urban capabilities (5Cs), which were initially
   introduced by the urbanist John Worthington, guided the content analysis
   of data. The results indicate that the lessons learned in the diverse
   urban projects can be scaled from a minor urban-area campus to a large
   urban area. Users of spaces have a need and will to collaborate,
   co-create, and impact their environments. This view expands the roles of
   decision makers and planners to controlling the uses of spaces for
   supporting grassroot initiatives. Consequently, active citizens engage
   and contribute, which can be a driving force for co-creation, shared
   ownership, and attractiveness of small-and large-scale areas.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A new frequency-agile scheme for the loaded stepped-impedance resonator
   (SIR) is introduced, which can be employed for designing a wideband
   tunable bandpass filter (BPF). Two identical capacitors are added to the
   two open ends, and a capacitor is added to the center of the SIR. By
   properly controlling their respective values, the even-mode resonant
   frequency (f(even)) can be bidirectionally tuned, resulting in a
   wideband tuning range (approximately double those of the traditional
   tunable resonators). However, in such frequency range, the odd-mode
   resonant frequency (f(odd)) functions as a spurious resonance would
   appear. To overcome this, the feed line is attached to the center of the
   SIR where it is always short-circuited for f(odd) and its odd-order
   harmonics, which cannot be excited accordingly. Thus, the wideband
   tuning range of the passband (f(even)) in the proposed BPF is validated
   to be meaningful, and the selectivity of the passband is improved due to
   the suppression of odd-mode spurious near the passband. For
   demonstration, a wideband tunable BPF is designed, and the simulated and
   measured results are presented, showing good agreement. The results
   showcase that the tuning range of passband reaches 84.4\%, i.e., from
   0.77 to 1.42 GHz with insertion loss from 3.1 to 1 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Large open and closed source organizations like Google, Facebook and
   Mozilla are migrating their products towards rapid releases. While this
   allows faster time-to-market and user feedback, it also implies less
   time for testing and bug fixing. Since initial research results indeed
   show that rapid releases fix proportionally less reported bugs than
   traditional releases, this paper investigates the changes in software
   testing effort after moving to rapid releases in the context of a case
   study on Mozilla Firefox, and performs a semi-systematic literature
   review. The case study analyzes the results of 312,502 execution runs of
   the 1,547 mostly manual system-level test cases of Mozilla Firefox from
   2006 to 2012 (5 major traditional and 9 major rapid releases), and
   triangulates our findings with a Mozilla QA engineer. We find that rapid
   releases have a narrower test scope that enables a deeper investigation
   of the features and regressions with the highest risk. Furthermore,
   rapid releases make testing more continuous and have proportionally
   smaller spikes before the main release. However, rapid releases make it
   more difficult to build a large testing community , and they decrease
   test suite diversity and make testing more deadline oriented. In
   addition, our semi-systematic literature review presents the benefits,
   problems and enablers of rapid releases from 24 papers found using
   systematic search queries and a similar amount of papers found through
   other means. The literature review shows that rapid releases are a
   prevalent industrial practice that are utilized even in some highly
   critical domains of software engineering, and that rapid releases
   originated from several software development methodologies such as
   agile, open source, lean and internet-speed software development.
   However, empirical studies proving evidence of the claimed advantages
   and disadvantages of rapid releases are scarce.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite their potential for improving health outcomes,
   mobile-based home monitoring systems for heart failure have not yet been
   taken up widely by the patients and providers.
   Objectives: To design and iteratively move towards a personalised mobile
   health monitoring system for patients living with heart failure,
   according to their health care and usability needs.
   Methods: We present an iterative approach to refining a remote health
   monitoring system that is based on interactions between different actors
   (patients, clinicians, social scientists and engineers) and supports the
   collection of quantitative and qualitative information about user
   experience and engagement. Patients were provided with tablet computers
   and commercially available sensing devices (a blood pressure monitor, a
   set of weighing scales, and a pulse oximeter) in order to complete
   physiological measurements at home, answer symptom-specific
   questionnaires, review their personal readings, view educational
   material on heart failure self-management, and communicate with their
   health professionals. The system supported unobtrusive remote software
   upgrades via an application distribution channel and the activation or
   deactivation of functional components by health professionals during
   run-time operation. We report early findings from the application of
   this approach in a cohort of 26 heart failure patients (mean age 72 +/-
   15 years), their caregivers and healthcare professionals who
   participated in the SUPPORT-HF (Seamless User-centred Proactive
   Provision Of Risk-stratified Treatment for Heart Failure) study over a
   one-year study period (mean patient follow-up duration = 270 +/- 62
   days).
   Results: The approach employed in this study led to several system
   upgrades dealing in particular with patient requirements for better
   communication with the development team and personalised self-monitoring
   interfaces. Engagement with the system was constantly high throughout
   the study and during the last week of the evaluation, 23 patients (88\%)
   used the system at least once and 16 patients (62\%) at least three
   times.
   Conclusions: Designers of future mobile-based home monitoring systems
   for heart failure and other chronic conditions could leverage the
   described approach as a means of meeting patients' needs during system
   use within the home environment and facilitating successful uptake. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and modeling of a low-cost and
   reliable small unmanned aerial vehicle research platform for advanced
   control implementation. The platform is mostly constructed of low-cost
   commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The only non-COTS components
   are the airdata probes, which are manufactured and calibrated in-house.
   The airframe used is the commercially available radio-controlled (R/C)
   6-foot Telemaster airplane from Hobby Express, chosen mainly for its
   adequately spacious fuselage and for being reasonably stable and
   sufficiently agile. One noteworthy feature of this platform is the use
   of two separate low-cost onboard computers for handling the data
   management/hardware interfacing and control computation. Specifically,
   the single board computer, Gumstix Overo Fire, is used to execute the
   control algorithms, whereas the open source autopilot, Ardupilot Mega,
   is mostly used to interface the Overo computer with the sensors and
   actuators. The platform supports multi-vehicle operations through the
   use of a radio modem that enables multi-point communications. As the
   goal of this platform is to implement rigorous control algorithms for
   real-time trajectory tracking and distributed control, it is important
   to derive an appropriate flight dynamic model of the platform, based on
   which the controllers will be synthesized. For that matter, the paper
   provides reasonably accurate models of the vehicle, servomotors, and
   propulsion system. Namely, the output error method is used to estimate
   the longitudinal and lateral-directional aerodynamic parameters from
   flight test data. The moments of inertia of the platform are determined
   using the simple pendulum test method, and the frequency response of
   each servomotor is also obtained experimentally. The Javaprop applet is
   used to obtain lookup tables relating airspeed to propeller thrust at
   constant throttle settings.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the types of software engineering (SE) practices and
   techniques used in industry is important. There is a wide spectrum in
   terms of the types and maturity of SE practices conducted in industry.
   Turkey has a vibrant software industry and it is important to
   characterize and understand the state of its SE practices. Our objective
   is to characterize and grasp a high-level view on type of SE practices
   in the Turkish software industry. To achieve this objective, we
   systematically designed an online survey with 46 questions based on our
   past experience in the Canadian and Turkish contexts and using the
   Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Two hundred and two
   practicing software engineers from the Turkish software industry
   participated in the survey. The survey results reveal important and
   interesting findings about SE practices in Turkey and beyond. They also
   help track the profession of SE, and suggest areas for improved
   training, education and research. Among the findings are the followings:
   (1) The military and defense software sectors are quite prominent in
   Turkey, especially in the capital Ankara region, and many SE
   practitioners work for those companies. (2) 54\% of the participants
   reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33\%
   mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of
   effort, after the development phase (on average, 31\% of overall project
   effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases
   come next and have similar average values (14\%, 12\%, 12\% and 11\%
   respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the
   requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used
   lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents
   (53\%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and
   Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38\% and 34\%,
   respectively. (6) The Waterfall and Agile methodologies have slight
   negative correlations, denoting that if one is used in a company, the
   other will less likely to be used. The results of our survey will be of
   interest to SE professionals both in Turkey and world-wide. It will also
   benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in SE industry
   identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then
   hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in those
   areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial practices and experiences highlight that demand is dynamic
   and non-stationary. Research however has historically taken the
   perspective that stochastic demand is stationary therefore limiting its
   impact for practitioners. Manufacturers require schedules for multiple
   products that decide the quantity to be produced over a required time
   span. This work investigated the challenges for production in the
   framework of a single manufacturing line with multiple products and
   varying demand. The nature of varying demand of numerous products lends
   itself naturally to an agile manufacturing approach. We propose a new
   algorithm that iteratively refines production windows and adds products.
   This algorithm controls parallel genetic algorithms (pGA) that find
   production schedules while minimizing costs. The configuration of such a
   pGA was essential in influencing the quality of results. In particular
   providing initial solutions was an important factor. Two novel methods
   are proposed that generate initial solutions by transforming a
   production schedule into one with refined production windows. The first
   method is called factorial generation and the second one fractional
   generation method. A case study compares the two methods and shows that

Abstract = {{The adoption of technology for marketing is essential for the survival
   of small businesses and yet little is understood about owner-manager
   practice in this area. This paper aims to address that gap through a
   qualitative study of 24 owner-managed small businesses operating in the
   visitor economy. It found that there was a strong appetite for the
   adoption of technology for marketing and a clear recognition of its
   opportunities particularly related to how it could create a stronger
   market orientation and more agile marketing, adhering to the principles
   of effectual reasoning. However, the ability to take advantage of these
   opportunities was constrained by a lack of knowledge and in particular
   an inability to measure the return on investment. While the wider
   implications of the study are limited by the niche sample, a planning
   model for the adoption of technology for marketing is presented which
   can be tested through future research.}},

Abstract = {{The fluid dynamics of cephalopods has so far received little attention
   in the literature, due to their complexity in structure and locomotion.
   The flow around octopuses, in particular, can be complicated due to
   their agile and dexterous arms, which frequently display some of the
   most diverse mechanisms of motion. The study of this flow amounts to a
   specific instance of the hydrodynamics problem for rough tapered
   cylinder geometries. The outstanding manipulative and locomotor skills
   of octopuses could inspire the development of advanced robotic arms,
   able to operate in fluid environments. Our primary aim was to study the
   hydrodynamic characteristics of such bio-inspired robotic models and to
   derive the hydrodynamic force coefficients as a concise description of
   the vortical flow effects. Utilizing computational fluid dynamic
   methods, the coefficients were computed on realistic morphologies of
   octopus-like arm models undergoing prescribed solid-body movements; such
   motions occur in nature for short durations in time, e.g. during
   reaching movements and exploratory behaviors. Numerical simulations were
   performed on translating, impulsively rotating, and maneuvering arms,
   around which the flow field structures were investigated. The results
   reveal in detail the generation of complex vortical flow structures
   around the moving arms. Hydrodynamic forces acting on a translating arm
   depend on the angle of incidence; forces generated during impulsive
   rotations of the arms are independent of their exact morphology and the
   angle of rotation; periodic motions based on a slow recovery and a fast
   power stroke are able to produce considerable propulsive thrust while
   harmonic motions are not. Parts of these results have been employed in
   bio-inspired models of underwater robotic mechanisms. This investigation
   may further assist elucidating the hydrodynamics underlying aspects of
   octopus locomotion and exploratory behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the presence of loss-averse decision making behavior in
   practice, this article considers a supply chain consisting of a firm and
   strategic consumers who possess an S-shaped loss-averse utility
   function. In the model, consumers decide the purchase timing and the
   firm chooses the inventory level. We find that the loss-averse
   consumers' strategic purchasing behavior is determined by their
   perceived gain and loss from strategic purchase delay, and the given
   rationing risk. Thus, the firm that is cognizant of this property
   tailors its inventory stocking policy based on the consumers'
   loss-averse behavior such as their perceived values of gain and loss,
   and their sensitivity to them. We also demonstrate that the firm's
   equilibrium inventory stocking policy reflects both the economic logic
   of the traditional newsvendor inventory model, and the loss-averse
   behavior of consumers. The equilibrium order quantity is significantly
   different from those derived from models that assume that the consumers
   are risk neutral and homogeneous in their valuations. We show that the
   firm that ignores strategic consumer's loss-aversion behavior tends to
   keep an unnecessarily high inventory level that leads to excessive
   leftovers. Our numerical experiments further reveal that in some extreme
   cases the firm that ignores strategic consumer's loss-aversion behavior
   generates almost 92\% more leftovers than the firm that possesses
   consumers' loss-aversion information and takes it into account when
   making managerial decisions. To mitigate the consumer's forward-looking
   behavior, we propose the adoption of the practice of agile supply chain
   management, which possesses the following attributes: (i) procuring
   inventory after observing real-time demand information, (ii) enhanced
   design (which maintains the current production mix but improves the
   product performance to a higher level), and (iii) customized design
   (which maintains the current performance level but increases the variety
   of the current production line to meet consumers' specific demands). We
   show that such a practice can induce the consumer to make early
   purchases by increasing their rationing risk, increasing the product
   value, or diversifying the product line. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The Information Systems (IS) field has never been more relevant as
   digital innovations are emerging at a rapid pace fuelled by recombinant
   innovations based on digital infrastructures, advanced middle-ware
   layers, and mobile and ubiquitous technologies. This paper argues, based
   on a bibliometric study of the representation of a mobile ICT discourse
   within the AIS Senior Scholars' `basket' of eight IS journals over the
   past 15 years, that the field needs to become much more academically
   agile. The study showed that a mere 3.2\% of all papers published during
   this period had any relationship to one of the key technological
   phenomena in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The paper
   formulates the hypothesis that the relative shift in impact between
   European- and US-based journals within the `basket of 8' could have been
   influenced by editorial strategising to further encourage academic
   agility exploring new horizons rather than emphasis on further
   exploitation of existing ground. The paper, further argues that the IS
   field seems to more readily engage in a debate of phenomena involving
   centralised and organisationally-bound technological innovations whereas
   distributed, decentralised and infrastructural discourses find it much
   more difficult to gain a foothold. So, whilst the IS field may still be
   stuck in the mainframe age, it needs to move beyond in order to fully
   engage with the world we live in. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Critical systems require zero recovery time when a failure occurs in a

   defines the only two protocols, parallel redundancy protocol and
   high-availability seamless redundancy, which fulfill this requirement

   also provide a hot-plugging capability, which allows elements to be
   added to or removed from the network without interrupting communications

   for power utility automation in the recently published IEC 61850-90-4.
   The challenge is to obtain an efficient approach for use in electronic

Abstract = {{Recently, high-speed and short-distance networks are widely deployed and
   their necessity is rapidly increasing everyday. This type of networks is
   used in several network applications; such as Local Area Networks (LAN)
   and Data Center Networks (DCN). In LANs and DCNs, high-speed and
   short-distance networks are commonly deployed to connect between
   computing and storage elements in order to provide rapid services.
   Indeed, the overall performance of such networks is significantly
   influenced by the Congestion Control Algorithm (CCA) which suffers from
   the problem of bandwidth under-utilization, especially if the applied
   buffer regime is very small. In this paper, a novel loss-based CCA
   tailored for high-speed and Short-Distance (SD) networks, namely
   Agile-SD, has been proposed. The main contribution of the proposed CCA
   is to implement the mechanism of agility factor. Further, intensive
   simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance
   of Agile-SD compared to Compound and Cubic Which are the default CCAs of
   the most commonly used operating systems. The results of the simulation
   experiments show that the proposed CCA outperforms the compared CCAs in
   terms of average throughput, loss ratio and fairness, especially when a
   small buffer is applied. Moreover, Agile-SD shows lower sensitivity to
   the buffer size change and packet error rate variation which increases
   its efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been realized that resilience as a concept involves several
   contradictory definitions, both for instance resilience as agile
   adjustment and as robust resistance to situations. Our analysis of
   resilience concepts and models suggest that beyond simplistic
   definitions, it is possible to draw up a systemic resilience model
   (SyRes) that maintains these opposing characteristics without
   contradiction. We outline six functions in a systemic model, drawing
   primarily on resilience engineering, and disaster response:
   anticipation, monitoring, response, recovery, learning, and
   self-monitoring. The model consists of four areas: Event-based
   constraints, Functional Dependencies, Adaptive Capacity and Strategy.
   The paper describes dependencies between constraints, functions and
   strategies. We argue that models such as SyRes should be useful both for
   envisioning new resilience methods and metrics, as well as for
   engineering and evaluating resilient systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   suppliers and outsourcing appropriately. The current study results from
   two theses completed in the fields of agility and ISM. It begins with
   identifying the criteria to evaluate agile suppliers. Then these factors
   are ranked and categorized using the interpretive structural model. The
   results of this study depict that the delivery speed variable lays on
   the bottom level of the model outlet with quite high driving power. The
   delay reduction variable has the same characteristics. Next, using fuzzy
   hierarchical analysis method, the weight of the agility evaluation
   criteria of suppliers are measured and put as TOPSIS model input.
   Finally, six suppliers are rated using fuzzy TOPSIS method. The results
   of this study shows that the criteria with higher driving power and
   lower dependence have higher weight in AMP model. It is, therefore,
   necessary to focus on variables of the first and second level of model
   in order to increase suppliers' agility. In this study, the weight of

   open standards and facilitating systems projects, they have increasingly
   been used as a corporate architectural approach to create interoperable
   services-based software solutions that can more easily be reused and
   shared across disparate applications. In the context of software
   companies, most of them are small firms having enormous difficulties to
   keep competitive. One strategy to enhance their sustainability is to
   enlarge partnerships among them at a more valuable level by jointly
   offering (web) services-based solutions. However, their culture of
   collaboration is low, and partnerships are usually done with the same
   companies and sporadically. This article presents an approach to support
   a more intense collaboration among software companies to attend business
   opportunities in a more agile way, joining capacities and capabilities
   which they would not have if they worked alone. This requires, however,
   some preparedness. From the perspective of business processes, they
   should understand how to carry out a collaboration more properly. This
   is essentially what this article is about. It presents a comprehensive

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Bulletproof hosting Autonomous Systems (ASes) malicious ASes fully
   dedicated to supporting cybercrime provide freedom and resources for a
   cyber-criminal to operate. Their services include hosting a wide range
   of illegal content, botnet C\&C servers, and other malicious resources.
   Thousands of new ASes are registered every year, many of which are often
   used exclusively to facilitate cybercrime. A natural approach to
   squelching bulletproof hosting ASes is to develop a reputation system
   that can identify them for takedown by law enforcement and as input to
   other attack detection systems (e.g., spam filters, botnet detection
   systems). Unfortunately, current AS reputation systems rely primarily on
   data-plane monitoring of malicious activity from IP addresses (and thus
   can only detect malicious ASes after attacks are underway), and are not
   able to distinguish between malicious and legitimate but abused ASes.
   As a complement to these systems, in this paper, we explore a
   fundamentally different approach to establishing AS reputation. We
   present ASwatch, a system that identifies malicious ASes using
   exclusively the control-plane (i.e., routing) behavior of ASes.
   ASwatch's design is based on the intuition that, in an attempt to evade
   possible detection and remediation efforts, malicious ASes exhibit
   ``agile{''} control plane behavior (e.g., short-lived routes, aggressive
   re-wiring). We evaluate our system on known malicious ASes; our results
   show that ASwatch detects up to 93\% of malicious ASes with a 5\% false
   positive rate, which is reasonable to effectively complement existing
   defense systems.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems present a unique medium for resource sharing
   among cliques of participants (peers) in a distributed and
   self-organized manner. With the advent of mobile users and the
   increasing power of mobile devices, the spectrum of P2P capabilities
   should scale. Peers establish transient or persistent relationships with
   other peers based on mutual interest. Communicating peers may use
   intermediary peers to forward communication messages, if a direct link
   is beyond their communication range. A critical design parameter is
   establishing a resilient communication topology, yet reduce the overhead
   of control messages required to instill and maintain it. This rises as a
   significant hindrance in mobile environments, which pose additional
   challenges on P2P networks due to the heterogeneity of nodes, limited
   resources, dynamic contexts in addition to the inherited wireless
   network stringencies. Thus far, efforts in establishing P2P networks via
   super peers (SPs) have been capped by considering a subset of peer
   properties to evaluate their candidacy. This paper presents RobP2P, a
   robust architecture to construct mobile P2P networks and efficiently
   maintain network state. RobP2P introduces a SP selection protocol based
   on a dynamic score function that takes into account peers' capabilities
   and context, such as location and quality of connectivity. The paper
   also presents an agile utility function through which SPs can delegate
   monitoring responsibilities to comparably powerful and stable peers to
   ensure self-healing topology maintenance. We present an elaborate
   performance evaluation of RobP2P implemented on Network Simulator NS-3.
   Our results illustrate the efficiency of RobP2P, its resilience to
   failures, and the improvements in lowering overhead traffic while
   reliably maintaining the consistency of network state.}},

Abstract = {{Agile methods have different practices that ultimately foster intra-team
   knowledge sharing (KS). However, they do not provide recommendations
   about coping with inter-team KS. Supporting inter-team KS is fundamental
   in scaling agility across the entire organization, and is regarded as
   the new horizon for agile software development. This study seeks to
   understand inter-team knowledge sharing effectiveness in agile software
   development organizations. Using grounded theory, we analyzed data from
   four Brazilian organizations and also from an expert in agile methods
   implementation. We observed that the companies employ different work
   practices that allow knowledge sharing to occur across team boundaries.
   Our main contribution is a conceptual model that explains how effective
   knowledge sharing across agile teams depends on applying purposeful
   practices, along with organizational conditions and stimuli. This
   understanding represents an innovative focus within the context of agile
   methods and suggests what one needs to take into account when striving
   on this path. Yet, it yields opportunities for further studies in
   refining and extending the model to other organizational contexts.

Title = {{Communication and personality profiles of global software developers}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{113-131}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Context: Prior research has established that a small proportion of
   individuals dominate team communication during global software
   development. It is not known, however, how these members' contributions
   affect their teams' knowledge diffusion process, or whether their
   personality profiles are responsible for their dominant presence.
   Objective: We set out to address this gap through the study of
   repository artifacts.
   Method: Artifacts from ten teams were mined from the IBM Rational Jazz
   repository. We employed social network analysis (SNA) to group
   practitioners into two clusters, Top Members and Others, based on the
   numbers of messages they communicated and their engagement in task
   changes. SNA metrics (density, in-degree and closeness) were then used
   to study practitioners' importance in knowledge diffusion. Thereafter,
   we performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners' messages using
   linguistic dimensions that had been previously correlated with the Big
   Five personality profiles.
   Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners we found that Top Members
   occupied critical roles in knowledge diffusion, and demonstrated more
   openness to experience than the Others. Additionally, all personality
   profiles were represented during teamwork, although openness to
   experience, agreeableness and extroversion were particularly evident.
   However, no specific personality predicted members' involvement in
   knowledge diffusion.
   Conclusion: Task assignment that promotes highly connected team
   communication networks may mitigate tacit knowledge loss in global
   software teams. Additionally, while members expressing openness to
   experience are likely to be particularly driven to perform, this is not
   entirely responsible for a global team's success. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   changes in real time. Gauging and understanding team performance in such
   changing environments present a major challenge.
   Objective: This paper aims to understand how software developers
   experience the continuous adaptation of performance in a modern, highly
   volatile environment using Lean and Agile software development
   methodology. This understanding can be used as a basis for guiding
   formation and maintenance of high-performing teams, to inform
   performance improvement initiatives, and to improve working conditions
   for software developers.
   Method: A qualitative multiple-case study using thematic interviews was
   conducted with 16 experienced practitioners in five organisations.
   Results: We generated a grounded theory, Performance Alignment Work,
   showing how software developers experience performance. We found 33
   major categories of performance factors and relationships between the
   factors. A cross-case comparison revealed similarities and differences
   between different kinds and different sizes of organisations.
   Conclusions: Based on our study, software teams are engaged in a
   constant cycle of interpreting their own performance and negotiating its
   alignment with other stakeholders. While differences across
   organisational sizes exist, a common set of performance experiences is
   present despite differences in context variables. Enhancing performance
   experiences requires integration of soft factors, such as communication,
   team spirit, team identity, and values, into the overall development
   process. Our findings suggest a view of software development and
   software team performance that centres around behavioural and social
   sciences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity in structure and locomotion of cephalopods, such as the
   octopus, poses difficulties in modeling and simulation. Their slender
   arms, being highly agile and dexterous, often involve intense
   deformations, which are hard to simulate accurately, while
   simultaneously ensuring numerical stability and low diffusion of the
   transient motion results. Within the immersed-boundary framework, this
   paper focuses on an arm geometry performing prescribed motions that
   reflect octopus locomotion. The method is compared with a finite-volume
   numerical approach to determine the mesh requirements that must be
   employed for sufficiently capturing, not only the. near wall viscous
   flow, but also the off-body vortical flow field in intense forced
   motions. The objective is to demonstrate and exploit the generality of
   the immersed boundary approach to complex numerical simulations of
   deforming geometries. Incorporation of arm deformation was found to
   increase the output thrust of a single-arm system. It was further found
   that sculling motion combined with arm undulations provides an effective
   propulsive scheme for an octopus-like arm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{54-73}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Agile methods promote iterative development with short cycles, where
   user feedback from the previous iteration is used to refactor and
   improve the current version. To facilitate agile development of
   information systems, this paper offers three contributions. First, we
   introduce the concept of evolvability as a model quality characteristic.
   Evolvability refers to the expected implications of future model
   refactorings, both in terms of complexity of the required database
   evolution algorithm and in terms of the expected volume of data to
   evolve. Second, we propose extending the agile development cycle by
   using database profiling information to suggest adaptations to the
   conceptual model to improve performance. For every software release, the
   database profiler identifies and analyses navigational access patterns,
   and proposes model optimisations based on data characteristics, access
   patterns and a cost-benefit model. Based on an experimental evaluation
   of the profiler we discuss why the quality of conceptual models can
   generally benefit from profiling and how performance measurements convey
   semantic information. Third, we discuss the flow of semantic information
   when developing and using information systems.
   Beyond these contributions, we also make a case for using object
   databases in agile development environments. However, most of the
   presented concepts are also applicable to other database paradigms. (C)

Abstract = {{The evolution toward emerging active distribution networks (ADNs) can be
   realized via a real-time state estimation (RTSE) application facilitated
   by the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs). A critical challenge in
   deploying PMU-based RTSE applications at large scale is the lack of a
   scalable and flexible communication infrastructure for the timely (i.e.,
   sub-second) delivery of the high volume of synchronized and continuous
   synchrophasor measurements. We address this challenge by introducing a
   communication platform called C-DAX based on the information-centric
   networking (ICN) concept. With a topic-based publish-subscribe engine
   that decouples data producers and consumers in time and space, C-DAX
   enables efficient synchrophasor measurement delivery, as well as
   flexible and scalable (re) configuration of PMU data communication for
   seamless full observability of power conditions in complex and dynamic
   scenarios. Based on the derived set of requirements for supporting
   PMU-based RTSE in ADNs, we design the ICN-based C-DAX communication
   platform, together with a joint optimized physical network resource
   provisioning strategy, in order to enable the agile PMU data
   communications in near real-time. In this paper, C-DAX is validated via
   a field trial implementation deployed over a sample feeder in a
   real-distribution network; it is also evaluated through simulation-based
   experiments using a large set of real medium voltage grid topologies
   currently operating live in The Netherlands. This is the first work that
   applies emerging communication paradigms, such as ICN, to smart grids
   while maintaining the required hard real-time data delivery as
   demonstrated through field trials at national scale. As such, it aims to
   become a blueprint for the application of ICN-based general purpose
   communication platforms to ADNs.}},

   generate a new secret key to regain their secrecy. The sick sensors also
   use the best qualified neighbours to distribute the data parts among
   them to protect the data from eavesdropping and this will enhance the
   data reliability. In this study, they also present a powerful, realistic
   and agile ADV model and show how CHSHRD scheme can result in sensor
   regaining secrecy and achieving high data reliability, despite the
   adversary efforts to the contrary. The evaluation of the proposed scheme

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1040-1051}},

Abstract = {{The Agile project management methodology has been widely used in recent
   years as a means to counter the dangers of traditional, front-end
   planning methods that often lead to downstream development pathologies.
   Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with
   its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer
   collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness
   over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical
   studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the
   likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software
   development, it is still predominantly an IT phenomenon. But due to its
   success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of
   1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the
   effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project
   success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against
   organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of
   variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project,
   project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest
   that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of
   project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a
   marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these
   findings and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Context: Geographically distributed teams have adopted agile practices
   as a work strategy. One of these practices is Distributed Pair
   Programming (DPP). DPP consists in two developers working remotely on

   Objective: In this paper we sought to identify and synthesize papers
   that describe and analyze DPP both from teaching and practice
   perspectives. Method: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review to
   search for empirical evidence in eight digital libraries.
   Results: Most of the 34 DPP primary studies identified explore DPP from
   a teaching perspective. We found that DPP requires a specific
   infrastructure, but the existing studies do not explore the impact of
   the distribution in the details. There are many tools proposed that
   support DPP practice, but few of them are evaluated within a software

   Conclusion: We need more studies that explore the effects of Pair
   Programming in the context of Distributed Software Development, such as
   coordination and communication. Most of the studies do not empirically
   evaluate DPP in industry. There is also a need to propose guidelines to
   use DPP in industry and as a teaching strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{332-348}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of MIMO antennas and channel bonding in 802.11n wireless
   networks has resulted in a huge leap in capacity compared with legacy
   802.11 systems. This leap, however, adds complexity to optimizing
   transmission. Not only does the appropriate data rate need to be
   selected, but also the MIMO transmission technique (e.g., Spatial
   Diversity or Spatial Multiplexing), the number of streams, and the
   channel width. Incorporating these features into a rate adaptation (RA)
   solution requires a new set of rules to accurately evaluate channel
   conditions and select the appropriate transmission setting with minimal
   overhead. To address these challenges, our contributions in this work
   are two-fold. First, we propose a practical link metric that accurately
   captures channel conditions in MIMO 802.11n environments, and we call
   this metric diffSNR. Using diffSNR captured from real testbed
   environments, we build performance models that accuractely predict link
   quality in 95.5\% of test cases. Practicality and deployability are
   guaranteed with diffSNR as it can be measured on all off-the-shelf MIMO
   WiFi chipsets. Second, we propose ARAMIS (Agile Rate Adaptation for MIMO
   Systems), a standard-compliant, closed-loop RA solution that jointly
   adapts rate and bandwidth, and we utilize the diffSNR-based 802.11n
   performance models within ARAMIS's framework. ARAMIS adapts transmission
   rates on a per-packet basis; we believe it is the first closed-loop,
   802.11 RA algorithm that simultaneously adapts rate and channel width.
   We have implemented ARAMIS with diffSNR on Atheros-based devices and
   deployed it on our 15-node testbed. Our experiments show that ARAMIS
   accurately adapts to a wide variety of channel conditions with
   negligible overhead. Furthermore, ARAMIS outperforms existing RA
   algorithms in 802.11n environments with up to a 10-fold increase in
   throughput. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate formal analysis of two aspects of usability in a deployed

   as it is in the context of an agile development process. Our aim was to
   determine if formal modelling and analysis can contribute to improving
   usability, and if so, which style of modelling is most suitable. The
   purpose of the analysis is to inform configurers about how to interact
   with the system, so the system is more usable for participants, and to
   guide future developments. We consider redundancies in configuration
   rules defined by carers and participants and the interaction modality of
   the output messages. Two approaches to modelling are considered: a deep
   embedding in which devices, sensors and rules are represented explicitly
   by data structures in the modelling language and non-determinism is
   employed to model all possible device and sensor states, and a shallow
   embedding in which the rules and device and sensor states are
   represented directly in propositional logic. The former requires a
   conventional machine and a model-checker for analysis, whereas the
   latter is implemented using a SAT solver directly on the activity
   monitor hardware. We draw conclusions about the role of formal models
   and reasoning in deployed systems and the need for clear semantics and

Abstract = {{Halogen bonding (XB) is a new promising interaction pattern in medicinal
   chemistry. It has predominantly electrostatic nature - high
   electrostatic potential anisotropy. However to fully unleash the
   potential of XB in rational drug design fast and robust empirical
   methods of XB description should be developed. Current approaches rely
   heavily on ab initio calculation for each molecule studied. Thus fast
   prediction of electrostatic parameters for description of XB for
   arbitrary organic molecules is of paramount importance to promptly
   establish QSAR/QSPR, virtual screening and molecular docking pipelines
   suitable for today's agile development requirements. The two most
   promising approaches to describe anisotropic electrostatic models - the
   extra point (EP) charge model and the multipole expansion (ME) model -
   were studied on their ability (1) to describe ab initio molecular
   electrostatic potential (MEP) and (2) to produce parameters that can be
   predicted for each molecule empirically rather than estimated via ab
   initio calculations. The reference ab initio MEP was calculated for a
   set of 730 substituted halobenzenes. Parameters for anisotropic
   electrostatics of both empirical models (EP and ME) studied were
   extracted from ab initio MEP. The Free-Wilson and Hansch type QSPR
   models relating XB parameters with aromatic substituents were built and
   analyzed, providing the guidelines for further development.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new architecture of frequency-agile Doherty
   power amplifier (PA)-based RF front-end. This architecture incorporates
   a baseband equalizer that is implemented using finite-impulse-response
   (FIR) digital filters to improve the performance of Doherty PAs when
   driven with large bandwidth and multiband wireless radios. Depending on
   the center frequency and bandwidth of the input signal, the FIR filters
   of the proposed equalizer are synthesized to compensate for the nonideal
   frequency behavior of the RF building blocks of the Doherty PA. It is
   shown that the proposed architecture enables the Doherty PA to operate
   with significantly improved power efficiency and linearity performance
   beyond its nominal frequency of design, which is suitable for
   multistandard applications. As a matter of fact, when driven with a
   140-MHz bandwidth long-term evolution (LTE) signal centered around 2.30
   GHz, the average efficiency of a 2.14-GHz Doherty PA prototype with the
   proposed digital baseband equalizer is enhanced from 33.5\% to 44.7\%.
   Moreover, its linearity performance in terms of adjacent channel leakage
   ratio (ACLR) is improved from -21 to -26 dB. In addition, when operated
   in concurrent dual-band mode with two 20-MHz bandwidth LTE signals
   centered at 1.96 and 2.34 GHz, the proposed Doherty PA enabled a
   reduction in dc power consumption by nearly 15\%. Furthermore, it is
   demonstrated that the integration of the proposed baseband equalizer
   does not compromise the linearizability of the Doherty PA. To the best
   of the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of
   digital equalization for performance enhancement of RF Doherty PAs.}},

Journal = {{EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{640-693}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is a plethora of studies investigating object-oriented measures
   and their link with external quality attributes, but usefulness of the
   measures may differ across empirical studies. This study aims to
   aggregate and identify useful object-oriented measures, specifically
   those obtainable from the source code of object-oriented systems that
   have gone through such empirical evaluation. By conducting a systematic
   literature review, 99 primary studies were identified and traced to four
   external quality attributes: reliability, maintainability, effectiveness
   and functionality. A vote-counting approach was used to investigate the
   link between object-oriented measures and the attributes, and to also
   assess the consistency of the relation reported across empirical
   studies. Most of the studies investigate links between object-oriented
   measures and proxies for reliability attributes, followed by proxies for
   maintainability. The least investigated attributes were: effectiveness
   and functionality. Measures from the C\&K measurement suite were the
   most popular across studies. Vote-counting results suggest that
   complexity, cohesion, size and coupling measures have a better link with
   reliability and maintainability than inheritance measures. However,
   inheritance measures should not be overlooked during quality assessment
   initiatives; their link with reliability and maintainability could be
   context dependent. There were too few studies traced to effectiveness
   and functionality attributes; thus a meaningful vote-counting analysis
   could not be conducted for these attributes. Thus, there is a need for
   diversification of quality attributes investigated in empirical studies.
   This would help with identifying useful measures during quality
   assessment initiatives, and not just for reliability and maintainability
   aspects.}},

Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{11-21}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Training part-of-speech taggers (POS-taggers) requires iterative
   time-consuming convergence-dependable steps, which involve either
   expectation maximization or weight balancing processes, depending on
   whether the tagger uses stochastic or neural approaches, respectively.
   Due to the complexity of these steps, multilingual part-of-speech
   tagging can be an intractable task, where as the number of languages
   increases so does the time demanded by these steps. WiSARD (Wilkie,
   Stonham and Aleksander's Recognition Device), a weightless artificial
   neural network architecture that proved to be both robust and efficient
   in classification tasks, has been previously used in order to turn the
   training phase faster. WiSARD is a RAM-based system that requires only
   one memory writing operation to train each sentence. Additionally, the
   mechanism is capable of learning new tagged sentences during the
   classification phase, on an incremental basis. Nevertheless, parameters
   such as RAM size, context window, and probability bit mapping, make the
   multilingual part-of-speech tagging task hard. This article proposes
   mWANN-Tagger (multilingual Weightless Artificial Neural Network tagger),
   a WiSARD PUS-tagger. This tagger is proposed due to its one-pass
   learning capability. It allows language-specific parameter
   configurations to be thoroughly searched in quite an agile fashion.
   Experimental evaluation indicates that mWANN-Tagger either outperforms
   or matches state-of-art methods in accuracy with very low standard
   deviation, i.e., lower than 0.25\%. Experimental results also suggest
   that the vast majority of the languages can benefit from this
   architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{187-194}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a new, agile, method will be introduced for public
   relations planning. Existing planning methods all suggest that research
   and analysis should be the first phase, followed by strategy, smart
   goals and a detailed action plan, and ending with an evaluation of the
   results. These models provide an undesirable illusion of control. That
   is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in
   which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing
   constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders.
   Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more
   complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant
   publics implicates. That is why preference should be given to the view
   that communication is not so much communication between two or more
   actors but is a multi-way diachronic process of ongoing constructions of
   meanings in which one cannot foresee who is - or will be - involved, in
   what way, and what the results will be. To be successful, a more
   flexible planning method is needed in which change is a defining part
   during the process. Scrum is such a method. To make it applicable in
   public relations, this agile method, well-known in IT, needed to be
   expanded by supplementing theory on communication, change and
   reflectivity, and by enrichment of the common notion of evaluation. (C)

Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{143-163}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Context: Software industry has widely adopted Agile software development
   methods. Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known
   of the actual metrics use in Agile teams. Objective: The objective of
   this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of
   using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics
   that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software
   engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the
   used metrics.
   Method: This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on
   using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified
   774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper
   selection process.
   Results: The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of
   using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning,
   progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process
   problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although
   Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they
   also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in
   the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate.
   Conclusion: The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar
   to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be
   planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the
   process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on
   metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as
   they can offer the largest impact to the software industry. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Remote debugging facilities are a technical necessity for devices that
   lack appropriate input/output interfaces (display, keyboard, mouse) for
   programming (e.g., smartphones, mobile robots) or are simply unreachable

   solutions can prove awkward to use due to re-deployments. Empirical
   studies show us that on average 10.5 minutes per coding hour (over five

   lack facilities that would otherwise be available in a local setting

   three desirable properties that a remote debugging solution should

   Mercury, a remote debugging model based on reflection. Mercury supports

Journal = {{RADIO SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{431-442}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Specular meteor radars (SMRs) have become a widely used tool to observe
   horizontal winds at the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT).
   Typically 30 to 120min mean winds are obtained assuming horizontal
   homogeneity of the observed area (i.e., few hundreds of kilometer
   radius). The quality of the measured wind velocity vector depends on the
   number of detected meteors per altitude and time bins. In order to
   improve the wind measurements of typical SMRs, here we propose a
   multistatic and multifrequency approach that consists mainly on adding
   GPS synchronized receiving stations with interferometric capabilities to
   existing SMRs. Compared to typical SMRs operating in a monostatic mode,
   our new approach called MMARIA (Multistatic and Multifrequency Agile
   Radar for Investigations of the Atmosphere) allows us to (a) increase
   the number of meteors using the same transmitter (by more than 70\%),
   (b) increase the altitudinal coverage by 5-10 km higher depending on the

Abstract = {{Communication networks are changing. They are becoming more and more
   ``software-based.{''} Two trends reflect this: the use of software
   defined networking and the use of virtualization to exploit common
   off-the-shelf hardware to provide a wide array of network-resident
   functions. To truly achieve the vision shared by many service providers
   of a high-performance software-based network that is flexible,
   lower-cost, and agile, a fast and carefully designed network function
   virtualization platform along with a comprehensive SDN control plane is
   needed. The shift toward software-based network services broadens the
   type of networking capabilities offered in provider networks and cloud
   platforms by allowing network services to be dynamically deployed across
   shared hosts. Combining this with an SDN control plane that recognizes
   the power of a dynamically changing network infrastructure allows
   network functions to be placed when they are needed and where they are
   most appropriate in the network. Our system, SDNFV harmoniously combines
   the two fast moving technological directions of SDN and virtualization
   to further the goal of achieving a true software-based network.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-platform software development poses challenges to agile
   development teams in practicing continuous integration (CI) builds not
   only because such builds take a longer time to complete and are more
   likely to fail, but also because builds of different lengths and scopes

   this situation, three aspects of build automation in CI the structuring
   of source code modules, the management of intermediate and final build
   artifacts, and the execution of builds must be re-considered to account
   for the cross-platform characteristics. This paper discovers and
   documents a collection of ten patterns of CI builds for use in
   developing cross-platform software in the three aspects re-considered.
   These patterns are distilled from known uses of builds in existing
   software and from our experience in building commercial and open-source
   cross-platform software. As illustrated with an example adapted from the
   development of a real-world commercial cross-platform software product,
   the patterns can be effectively applied to solve many commonly

Abstract = {{The failure rate for vascular interventions (vein bypass grafting,

Title = {{A framework to canonicalize manufacturing service capability models}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{39-60}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The capability to share precisely defined information models, which
   reveal a supplier's manufacturing service capability (MSC) with anyone
   who needs it, is key to the creation of more agile supply chains. Today,
   unfortunately, this capability does not exist. Why? Because most
   suppliers use proprietary information models to represent and share
   their MSC information! This limits both the semantic precision in the
   models, which is needed for interoperability, and the level of agility
   in the supply chains. The availability of a semantically precise and
   rich reference MSC ontology could address both of these limitations.
   Based on our prior research, the development of such an ontology will
   require a semantic mediation process between the proprietary MSC models
   and the reference MSC ontology. At the heart of every known,
   semantic-mediation process is a mapping between a proprietary MSC model
   and the reference MSC ontology. Such a mapping must deal with the
   structural and semantic conflicts between the two. In this paper, we
   propose a new approach, which we call canonicalization to address the
   structural conflicts. The semantic conflicts are addressed using logical
   mapping. The canonicalization pre-processes the structural
   representations of the proprietary models and then aligns them using
   ontology design patterns which are also used in the reference ontology.
   This simplifies both the mapping problems themselves and the resulting
   mapping statements considerably. In the paper, we also demonstrate our
   approach and its benefits in the context of a description-logic-based
   semantic mediation using the Ontology Web Language (OWL). (C) 2015

Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{124-144}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Context: The processes of estimating, planning and managing are crucial
   for software development projects, since the results must be related to
   several business strategies. The broad expansion of the Internet and the
   global and interconnected economy make Web development projects be often
   characterized by expressions like delivering as soon as possible,
   reducing time to market and adapting to undefined requirements. In this
   kind of environment, traditional methodologies based on predictive
   techniques sometimes do not offer very satisfactory results. The rise of
   Agile methodologies and practices has provided some useful tools that,
   combined with Web Engineering techniques, can help to establish a
   framework to estimate, manage and plan Web development projects.
   Objective: This paper presents a proposal for estimating, planning and
   managing Web projects, by combining some existing Agile techniques with
   Web Engineering principles, presenting them as an unified framework
   which uses the business value to guide the delivery of features.
   Method: The proposal is analyzed by means of a case study, including a
   real-life project, in order to obtain relevant conclusions.
   Results: The results achieved after using the framework in a development
   project are presented, including interesting results on project planning
   and estimation, as well as on team productivity throughout the project.
   Conclusion: It is concluded that the framework can be useful in order to
   better manage Web-based projects, through a continuous value-based

Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{163-181}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Context: In the last decade, software development has been characterized
   by two major approaches: agile software development, which aims to
   achieve increased velocity and flexibility during the development
   process, and user-centered design, which places the goals and needs of
   the system's end-users at the center of software development in order to
   deliver software with appropriate usability. Hybrid development models,
   referred to as user-centered agile software development (UCASD) in this
   article, propose to combine the merits of both approaches in order to
   design software that is both useful and usable.
   Objective: This paper aims to capture the current state of the art in
   UCASD approaches and to derive generic principles from these approaches.
   More specifically, we investigate the following research question: Which
   principles constitute a user-centered agile software development
   approach?
   Method: We conduct a systematic review of the literature on UCASD.
   Identified works are analyzed using a coding scheme that differentiates
   four levels of UCASD: the process, practices, people/social and
   technology dimensions. Through subsequent synthesis, we derive generic
   principles of UCASD.
   Results: We identified and analyzed 83 relevant publications. The
   analysis resulted in a comprehensive coding system and five principles
   for UCASD: (1) separate product discovery and product creation, (2)
   iterative and incremental design and development, (3) parallel
   interwoven creation tracks, (4) continuous stakeholder involvement, and
   (5) artifact-mediated communication.
   Conclusion: Our paper contributes to the software development body of
   knowledge by (1) providing a broad overview of existing works in the
   area of UCASD, (2) deriving an analysis framework (in form a coding
   system) for works in this area, going beyond former classifications, and
   (3) identifying generic principles of UCASD and associating them with
   specific practices and processes. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{BaTiO3 thin films were deposited onto quartz substrates by RF magnetron

   films with a tetragonal structure with orientations along (101) plane.
   Average crystallite size increased from 12.52 to 14.87 nm as the film
   thickness increased from 207 to 554 nm. With the increase in film
   thickness, the structural disorder decreases and the crystalline quality
   of the films gradually improved. The film exhibited good adherence to
   the substrate and are crack free. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   revealed the presence of barium, titanium and oxygen in BT film. An
   average transmittance of >80 \% was observed for all the films. This
   high transmittance BT films in the visible region is suitable for
   various electro-optic applications. The transmittance spectra showed
   high UV-shielding properties. Optical band gap was found to decrease
   from 4.55 to 3.70 eV with increase of film thickness, whereas the
   refractive index was found to increase. The refractive index of the BT
   films can be tuned between 2.11 and 2.21 at 550 nm. The real and
   imaginary dielectric constants with increase in film thickness were
   investigated. The low dissipation factor of BT thin films makes it a
   promising material for frequency agile applications. The emission
   spectra of BT thin films consist of near band edge excitonic UV emission
   and defect related emission in the visible range. The PL emission bands
   in UV and visible region of BT thin films make them suitable for

Title = {{Collaboration optimization in software process composition}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{452-466}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe an optimization
   approach to maximize collaboration in software process composition. The
   research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software
   development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team
   members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to
   navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions.
   Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was
   evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a
   large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the
   feasibility of composing processes for three software development
   projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing
   (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search
   (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing
   the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to
   verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her
   expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable
   sequence of components.
   Findings: The main findings indicate that GA is more effective (best
   results regarding the fitness function) than HC and RS in the search of
   solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition
   for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small
   instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a
   context. These SBSE results were complemented by the feedback given by
   specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity,
   adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager
   during the decision making in process composition.
   Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single
   company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality
   restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed
   to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample
   prevents generalization for other types of projects or different
   contexts.
   Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are
   facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition,
   since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process
   composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by
   presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes
   both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through
   software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the
   standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions
   in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile,
   and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase
   collaboration in software development.
   Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage
   collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it
   brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on
   the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area. Finally,
   this work expands the body of knowledge in SBSE to the field of software
   process which has not been properly explored by former research. (C)

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) networks comprise a number of spectrum agile nodes
   with the capability of spectrum detection. Applying techniques of
   spectrum sharing in CR networks can achieve the efficient utilization of
   network resources. Usually, data rates of user sessions are time varied
   because of the dynamic behaviors of CR networks. It is expected that the
   occurrence of link outage should be avoided and incorporated into the
   routing design under conditions of increasingly crowded spectrum. This
   paper proposes an integral framework, which considers these two
   correlated schemes (resource reconfiguration and robust routing)
   simultaneously. For that, the resource reconfiguration scheme is
   developed for the efficient usage of network resources and aims at
   reducing the occupancy of licensed bands. The link outage, resulting
   from random session rate, is confined within an acceptable range by
   using strategy of virtual network portfolio'. A robust optimization
   approach is proposed to guarantee reliable data transmission among
   possible interfering links. Both these two items (resource
   reconfiguration and robust routing) are formulated in a framework of
   cross-layer optimization. The evolutionary process of CR network states
   is provided in simulations, where the results show that the joint design
   proposal can achieve the least interferences among different licensed
   users while realizing robust routing. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{As the foundation of EDI, B2C and B2B, distributed computing is a key
   enabler for today's enterprises and will become even more important with
   the advent of cloud computing on the one hand and an ever more agile
   work organization on the other hand. Whilst the rapid evolution of
   distributed computing technologies in the last three decades has
   delivered a rich set of platforms and paradigms for building robust
   enterprise systems, it has also left a legacy of unresolved problems
   including fundamental inconsistencies between the concepts of the two
   leading distributed computing paradigms, i.e., distributed object
   computing and service-oriented architecture. Equally important, there is
   a growing need to lower the complexities and barriers involved in
   developing client applications, which range from large scale business
   applications and business processes to laptop programs and small apps on
   mobile devices. In this article, we present a unified conceptual
   framework for service-oriented computing based on the proven MDA (Model

   consolidate, and give semantics to, core concepts of service-oriented
   computing and provide a set of foundational model transformation
   patterns that map between the presented concepts and further clarify
   practical service-oriented computing scenarios. Finally, we show how the

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a reconfigurable multiband extended U-slot antenna
   with polarization diversity for wireless applications. The antenna is
   able to switch among linear polarization (LP) and left-hand (LH) and
   right-hand (RH) circular polarizations (CPs) for 2.4-/5.8-GHz wireless
   local area network (WLAN) systems. The antenna is composed of an
   extended U-slot patch with modified ground plane and two p-i-n diodes to
   switch the slots at ON-and OFF-states. The p-i-n diodes are
   appropriately positioned to change the length of the slot arms, which
   alters the antenna's polarization with frequency diversity to operate in
   four states. The simulated and measured results verified the
   effectiveness of the proposed antenna configuration. The experimental
   bandwidths of the 10-dB return loss for RHCP and LHCP of 2.4-GHz WLAN
   are similar about 320 MHz (2.3-2.6 GHz), whereas for LP, the bandwidth
   is about 500 MHz (2.4-2.9 GHz). The bandwidths of the 3-dB axial ratio
   for the RHCP and LHCP states are about 400 MHz on the broadside
   direction for 2.4-GHz WLAN. The bandwidths for RHCP and LHCP of 5.8-GHz
   WLAN are about 500 MHz (5.6-6.1 GHz), whereas for LP, the bandwidth has
   two states about 300 MHz (5.7-6 GHz) and 600 MHz (5.3-5.9 GHz). This
   reconfigurable patch antenna with agile polarization and frequency
   diversity has good performance and concise structure, which can be also
   used for LP at 2.6-GHz Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
   (WiMAX), digital multimedia broadcasting, 3.5-GHz WiMAX, C-band
   satellite (downlink), and HiperLAN/2 systems.}},

Abstract = {{With its agile spectrum management in the optical layer, the
   flexible-grid elastic optical network can become a promising physical
   infrastructure to efficiently support the highly dynamic traffic in
   future datacenter interconnections (DCIs). While the resulting elastic
   optical DCIs (EO-DCIs) need to serve requests that not only require
   bandwidth resources on fiber links but also require multidimensional IT
   resources in the DCs, multidimensional resource fragmentation can occur
   during dynamic network operations and deteriorate the network
   performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates the problem
   of joint defragmentation (DF) for the spectrum and IT resources in
   EO-DCIs. Specifically, we reoptimize the allocations of multidimensional
   resources jointly with complexity-controlled network reconfigurations.
   For the DFoperation, we first study the request selection process and
   propose a joint selection strategy that can perform the spectrum-and
   IT-oriented selections adaptively according to the network status. Then,
   we formulate a mixed integer linear programming model and design several
   heuristics to tackle the problem of network reconfiguration in the joint
   DF. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with extensive simulations.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint DF algorithms can
   significantly reduce the blocking probability in EO-DCIs by
   consolidating the spectrum and IT resource usages effectively.}},

   for adapting the sensor transmit waveform to match the environment and
   to optimize the selected performance metric. We specifically concentrate
   on radar and underwater acoustic signal transmission environments. As we
   consider systems with potentially large number of sensors, we discuss
   the use of resource-agile implementation approaches based on
   multiple-core processors in order to efficiently implement the
   computationally intensive processing in configuring the sensors. These
   resource-agile approaches can be extended to also optimize sensing in

Abstract = {{Maturity models are used to guide improvements in the software
   engineering field and a number of maturity models for agile methods have
   been proposed in the last years. These models differ in their underlying

   to empirically investigate how agile teams evolve to maturity, as a
   means to conceive a theory for agile software development evolvement
   that considers agile teams nature. The complex adaptive systems theory
   was used as a lens for analysis and four case studies were conducted to
   collect qualitative and quantitative data. As a result, we propose the
   Progressive Outcomes framework to describe the agile software
   development maturing process. It is a framework in which people have the
   central role, ambidexterity is a key ability to maturity, and
   improvement is guided by outcomes agile teams pursue, instead of

Abstract = {{A software-defined network (SDN) enables agile network control and
   configuration as well as shortens the network function deployment time.
   Despite the projected benefits of an SDN, the abstractions toward the
   remote and centralized control tend to impose excessive control traffic
   overhead in order for the controller to acquire global network
   visibility as well as extend the legacy network's inaccurate and
   unreliable management problems into the control plane. In addition, many
   recent SDNs facilitate multiple management pillars (such as customized
   interfaces and protocols) so that user applications can directly
   communicate to the data plane to measure and monitor specific
   information. Not only logical control centralization, but also
   virtualization of the underlying computing and network resources add
   demands of more flexible and programmable monitoring functions per the
   virtual domain. A complex combination of multiple and heterogeneous
   management channels introduces the significant scalability, control
   tuning, and reliability problems in SDN. In this paper, to address the
   above control and management problems, we propose a highly scalable and
   reliable SDN control and management architecture, called IRIS Control
   and Management (IRIS-CoMan). It builds an intelligent agent based hybrid
   SDN architecture by providing a control and management abstraction and
   filtering layer. It serves an essential component for the reliable,
   scalable, and secure SDN deployment. We present design, implementation,

Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{1-24}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Enabling process changes constitutes a major challenge for any
   process-aware information system. This not only holds for processes
   running within a single enterprise, but also for collaborative scenarios
   involving distributed and autonomous partners. In particular, if one
   partner adapts its private process, the change might affect the
   processes of the other partners as well. Accordingly, it might have to
   be propagated to concerned partners in a transitive way. A fundamental
   challenge in this context is to find ways of propagating the changes in
   a decentralized manner. Existing approaches are limited with respect to
   the change operations considered as well as their dependency on a
   particular process specification language. This paper presents a generic
   change propagation approach that is based on the Refined Process
   Structure Tree, i.e., the approach is independent of a specific process
   specification language. Further, it considers a comprehensive set of
   change patterns. For all these change patterns, it is shown that the
   provided change propagation algorithms preserve consistency and
   compatibility of the process choreography. Finally, a proof-of-concept
   prototype of a change propagation framework for process choreographies
   is presented. Overall, comprehensive change support in process
   choreographies will foster the implementation and operational support of
   agile collaborative process scenarios. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Corporate memory (CM) is a major asset of any modern organization and

   The qualitative nature of the data makes it difficult to analyze using
   standard statistical techniques. The rough set approach is suitable for

Abstract = {{Improving performance of global supply chains requires careful
   consideration of various factors including distance from markets, access
   to resources, exchange and tax rates, import tariffs, and trade
   regulations. In this paper, a comprehensive optimization model is
   proposed to maximise the after-tax profit of a closed-loop global supply
   chain for medical devices under uncertainty. The uncertainty of the
   decision-making environment is modelled using the budget of uncertainty
   concept in interval robust optimization. International financial issues
   due to the Economic Cooperation Organisation Trade Agreement as well as
   national regulations including transfer pricing limitations, exchange
   rates, tax rates, and import tariffs are considered. The proposed model
   considers various realistic assumptions pertaining to medical device
   supply chains such as multiple products, multiple periods, multiple
   echelons, and limited warehousing lifetime. In addition, reverse flows
   of perished and defective products are considered to address
   environmental concerns and customers' requirements as well as to gain
   economic advantages. To tackle this problem, an efficient memetic
   algorithm is developed that incorporates adaptive variable neighbourhood
   search as its local search heuristic. Computational results demonstrate
   the efficiency of the proposed model in dealing with uncertainty in an

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{43+}},
Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{In today's dynamic and competitive world, a project manager's key
   challenge is coping with frequent unexpected events. Such events can be
   classified according to their level of predictability as follows: events
   that were anticipated but whose impacts were much stronger than
   expected; events that could not have been predicted; and events that
   could have been predicted but were not. Coping with frequent unexpected
   events requires an organizational culture that allows the project
   manager to exercise a great amount of flexibility.
   The traditional approach to project management emphasizes that project
   success depends on stability. According to this approach, project
   success can be achieved by focusing on planning and on controlling and
   managing risks. Although the popularity of this approach has sharply
   increased across industries, research covering a wide variety of
   projects consistently reveals poor performance.
   The authors collected data from more than 150 successful project
   managers affiliated with more than 20 organizations and concluded that
   today's successful project managers cope with unexpected events by a
   combination of traditional and ``agile{''} approaches to project
   management. Using business examples drawn from their research at
   organizations such as Procter \& Gamble, NASA and the construction
   services company Boldt, the authors identified four key roles that
   successful project managers play:
   The first role, developing collaboration, is performed early on during
   the project.
   The second role, integrating planning and review with learning, is
   performed periodically throughout the project.
   The third role, preventing major disruptions, is performed occasionally.
   The fourth role, maintaining forward momentum, is performed
   continuously.
   Today's managers must be people-oriented, information-oriented and
   action-oriented. The authors argue that by assuming the four roles
   discussed in this article, successful project managers will embrace all
   three orientations.
